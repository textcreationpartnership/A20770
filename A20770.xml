            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10362:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Satan, I held it nece≈ø≈øary with all diligence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what might be the <hi>true nature</hi> and definition thereof, and at length I re≈øolued that the Act thereof was not A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but Affiance, the Subiect not the vnder≈øtanding, but the will; and the Obiect not pre≈øent grace and future glory, but the per≈øon of the Mediator. So that I defined it, not as vulgarly it is conceiued, An a≈øsurance that we are already ju≈øtified and ≈øhall be ≈øaued; but thus, An affiance vpon Chri≈øt the Mediator for ju≈øtification and con≈øequently Saluation. The occa≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> mouing me to intreat of this argument was this; A certaine graue and godly Matrone of that City hauing beene a long time ≈øore afflicted with ≈øickne≈øse both in mind and body, I went vpon entreaty with other friends to vi≈øit her; and after mutuall ≈øalutation, Si≈øter quoth I vnto her, were I Phy≈øitian for the body, I would adui≈øe you the be≈øt I could for the health thereof: but it is not my element, and therefore I may not without great ra≈øhne≈øse put my ≈øelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: neuerthele≈øse if you ≈øhall plea≈øe to di≈øcouer vnto me the wound of your ≈øpirit, happily I may apply ≈øuch a ≈øalue thereunto, as by the ble≈øsing of God may clo≈øe it vp, or at lea≈øt giue ≈øome refocilation and ea≈øe vnto the angui≈øh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. My wound then, quoth ≈øhe, in a word is this: I want faith; And what may be the ground, quoth I, of this per≈øwa≈øion? Becau≈øe, quoth ≈øhe, <hi>I am not a≈ø≈øured that</hi> I <hi>am iu≈øtified and ≈øhall be ≈øaued:</hi> A weake ground, quoth I, ≈øeeing a man may haue Faith that wanteth ≈øuch A≈øsurance; how may that be, quoth ≈øhe? for as hitherto I haue beene taught, Faith is no other then A≈øsurance: then haue you beene taught ami≈øse, quoth I: and if this be all the ≈øcruple that troubleth you, <hi>I</hi> hope ere we part to fini≈øh the cure. Thereupon I began freely to declare what I conceiued of the <hi>true nature of iu≈øtifying Faith,</hi> and proued vnto her by ≈øundrie remon≈øtrances that <pb facs="tcp:10362:3"/> it was not <hi>A≈ø≈øurance</hi> but
<hi>Affiance,</hi> and with ≈øo good ≈øucce≈øse, that both ≈øhe and all that were pre≈øent re≈øted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with much comforted and contented. Only they prayed me both for their owne confirmation, and the farther informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, that I would be plea≈øed to ≈øpeak of it againe in a more publike audience: wherevnto (≈øeeing no rea≈øon to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade me) I readily conde≈øcended, and on the text afore≈øaid handled the matter ≈øomewhat largely.</p>
                  <p>This Sermon at lea≈øt ≈øo farre as concernes the Definition of Faith was by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baxter then preacher of that City greatly di≈øta≈øted and di≈øliked: in ≈øo much as by me≈øsage he threatned me with open confutation thereof in the Pulpit, vnle≈øse I gaue him the ≈øpeedier &amp; better ≈øatisfaction; which threatning though I little feared, knowing <hi>I had built nor hay nor ≈øtubble vpon the foundation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.13.</note> but ≈øuch doctrines as were well able <hi>to endure the triall of the fire:</hi> yet becau≈øe the Apo≈øtle chargeth <hi>to be ready alwayes to giue an≈øwere to euery man that asketh a rea≈øon of the Hope that is in vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> I was eft≈øoones willing the be≈øt I could to ≈øatisfie him. Being therefore by the mediation of ≈øome friends brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with him, I prayed him to remember that what≈øoeuer I ≈øayd in that Sermon was not barely affirmed but ≈øoundly proued, and therefore he might not in rea≈øon demaund ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of me vntill him≈øelfe had ≈øatisfied my rea≈øons: which if he ≈øhould ≈øubstantially doe, I would ea≈øe him of his Pulpit-confutation, and the ≈øame tongue that broched the errour, ≈øhould in the ≈øame place againe reuoke it. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>I</hi> to pre≈ø≈øe him with this argument, <hi>If faith be A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then God commanding a Reprobate to beleeue, commands him al≈øo to be a≈ø≈øured,</hi> which is ab≈øurd: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all his an≈øwere was, <hi>who art thou that di≈øpute≈øt with God? I</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.20.</note> that <hi>I</hi> neither di≈øputed with God nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled <pb facs="tcp:10362:4"/> his actions: but only denyed that <hi>God commands a Reprobate to be a≈ø≈øured,</hi> for ≈øo he ≈øhould command that to be beleeued for true, which nor is nor euer ≈øhall be true. Againe I argued thus, <hi>If Faith be A≈ø≈øurance, then who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wanteth A≈ø≈øurance wanteth Faith, which to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øed ≈øoule is mo≈øt vncomfortable.</hi> To this he an≈øwered that de≈øire of A≈ø≈øurance is in the acceptation of God as A≈øsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it ≈øelfe. I replyed, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins</hi> being vrged with the ≈øame Obiection an≈øwered in the ≈øame manner, but vn≈øufficiently: for if actuall Faith be nece≈øsary to iu≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then is actuall A≈ø≈øurance al≈øo nece≈ø≈øary if Faith be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance: Here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> would needs take occa≈øion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtulate, why I ≈øhould pre≈øume to define otherwi≈øe then <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Perkins,</hi> and ≈øo many worthy Divines had done before mee. Wherevnto I an≈øwered roundly and plainely, <hi>Socrates is deare,</hi>

                     <hi>ri.</hi> But I doe ≈øo re≈øt vpon Chri≈øt; This the Con≈øcience priuy to the ≈øincerity of the heart a≈ø≈øumeth, which act of Re≈øting I tearme Iu≈øtifying Faith:</p>

                  <p>To draw to a Conclu≈øion, concerning the≈øe three Faiths I adde farther, that to the Faith of Story many doe not a≈øpire, namely ≈øuch Paynims and Gentiles to whom God hath not vouch≈øafed the Mini≈øtery of the Word and meanes of knowledge: yet many Reprobates doe, liuing within the compa≈ø≈øe and territory of the Church, and remaine for all that vniu≈øtified. Vnto the Faith of Per≈øon, and that Affiance which I call ≈øleight and ≈øuperficiall, many likewi≈øe of the ve≈ø≈øels of wrath doe attaine, but cannot goe one ≈øtep farther, whereas all and euery of the Elect re≈øt on Chri≈øt in the ≈øecond man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and vpon the precedents before ≈øpecified, and are thereby iu≈øtified.

So that by the iudgement of the≈øe men, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting to Gods Word in generall, and to the Go≈øpell in ≈øpeciall, is not a Speciall but Generall Knowledge: and if the Speciality of the Go≈øpell being but a part of the whole Scripture did ≈øpecify Faith, it would follow thereupon that there are as many Speciall Faiths as there are ≈øeuerall Articles of the Creed, which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonable to imagine. For that Faith which a≈ø≈øenteth vnto the Go≈øpell is no other then that which a≈ø≈øenteth vnto the re≈øt of holy Scripture: and although it may principally re≈øpect that part of diuine truth, yet doth it not only re≈øpect it, nor is limited thereunto as vnto the proper adequate obiect thereof, but vniuer≈øally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ≈øelfe vnto all ≈øupernaturall reuealed verities what≈øoeuer.

                     <p>This notwith≈øtanding very peremptorily you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that

For if you vnder≈øtand thereby a Pre-requi≈øite or Preparatiue vnto iu≈øtifying Faith, you doe but fight with a ≈øhadow, for in that ≈øence I grant the Conclu≈øion, neither doth ≈øuch a beginning of Iu≈øtifying Faith iu≈øtify. If you meane thereby that it is Iu≈øtifying Faith inchoat and in a remi≈ø≈øer degree, then I deny your Maior, and ≈øay that ≈øuch a knowledge (call it as you plea≈øe generall or ≈øpeciall) is not the beginning of iu≈øtifying Faith; If it were, then Diuels and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates hauing it ≈øhould haue iu≈øtifying Faith which Gods Word attributes vnto the Elect onely.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> And if it bee true that Faith of per≈øon is the con≈øummation of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifying Faith as in the former ≈øection you ≈øay, it cannot bee that ≈øuch a knowledge ≈øhould bee the Beginning thereof: vnle≈ø≈øe you will ≈øay that Accidents may pa≈ø≈øe from one Subiect to another, which is again≈øt all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy. For Hi≈øtoricall Faith is in the Vnder≈øtanding, and Faith of Per≈øon is in the Will: and therefore Faith <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10362:37"/> of Story beginning in the Mind can haue no ≈øub≈øi≈øtence el≈øewhere, and iu≈øtifying Faith being perfected in the Will cannot bee begunne in any other Subiect.

Many ≈øeeds lye in my hand together, yet euery one hath his ≈øeuerall and di≈øtinct vertue: Faith of Per≈øon is neuer without Faith of Story, yet it is Faith of Per≈øon which onely iu≈øtifies.

Such officiou≈øne≈ø≈øe in an aduer≈øary is not without ≈øu≈øpicion: and if you may haue the hammering of my arguments, your weake≈øt an≈øwers I doubt not will be proofe inough again≈øt them. Leaue me therfore I pray you to the meaning of my own weapons, and looke you well vnto your owne defence; for I feare mee you will hardly bee able to auoid the danger of them. For thus I rea≈øon, <hi>That Faith which Diuels and Reprobates haue, iustifies not: Hi≈øtoricall Faith Diuels and Reprobates haue,</hi> Ergo
<hi>Hi≈øtoricall Faith iu≈øtifies not.</hi> Here you ≈øee nor creeping, nor incroching, but faire and plaine dealing and ≈øuch as I am well content all noble Schollers marke it. But let vs ≈øee what you reioyne hereunto.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, you ≈øay I beg the matter in Que≈øtion. What matter? that Hi≈øtoricall Faith is a generall knowledge; but neither is that the matter now in Que≈øtion, neither doe I any way beg it. For in this Syllogi≈øme the Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether Hi≈øtoricall Faith doe iu≈øtify, of your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion there appeares nor palme nor foot≈øtep: which yet in the former ≈øection again≈øt your negatiue I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to bee mo≈øt true. That which you adde if it bee not ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe is contrary both to your ≈øelfe and vnto rea≈øon. For ≈øaying that Hi≈øtoricall Faith is proper and ≈øpeciall vnto the Elect in the beginning of their iu≈øtifying Faith,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10362:39"/> you plainely di≈øtingui≈øh it from iu≈øtifying Faith, which is contrary to what you haue el≈øewhere ≈øaid. If you ≈øtill confound them and make Hi≈øtoricall Faith the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Iu≈øtifying Faith, it is as if you ≈øhould ≈øay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of iu≈øtifying Faith, is ≈øpeciall and peculiar vnto the Elect in the beginning of their iu≈øtifying Faith, which is altogether witle≈ø≈øe and ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe. La≈øtly, to ≈øay that Hi≈øtoricall Faith which before was Generall and common as ≈øoone as it is conioyned with applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Re≈øting on Chri≈øt becomes ≈øpeciall and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, is vtterly void of rea≈øon. For as Grace ≈øuperadded vnto Nature in the Elect makes not Nature ≈øpeciall and peculiar vnto them, but that ≈øtill it remaines common vnto all men: ≈øo al≈øo Hi≈øtoricall Faith by acce≈ø≈øion of Iu≈øtifying Faith or Affiance changeth not its nature and becomes Speciall, but as it was euermore continues Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Generall I ≈øay, both Obiectiuely as ≈øtretching it ≈øelfe vnto all ≈øupernaturall reuealed verities: and Subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely not being appropriated vnto the Elect onely, but commonly incident vnto others al≈øo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly you deny the Minor, telling mee plainely that <hi>it is ridiculous yea bla≈øphemous to ≈øay that Diuels haue Faith, or that euer Balaam, Iudas, or Magus had Faith.</hi> If I ≈øhould now temper my inke with ≈øome ≈øhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ingredient, and in the zeale of my affection ≈øay vnto you as the Angell ≈øometime ≈øaid vnto Satan,<note place="margin">Iude 9.</note>

                     <p>Yet <hi>Caluin,</hi> you ≈øay, telleth mee it is

Certainly if you wil giue him leaue to <pb n="64" facs="tcp:10362:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> bee the interpreter of his owne meaning you ≈øhall find hee doth not. For when hee denieth that Diuels haue Faith, and that <hi>Saint Iames</hi> there di≈øputeth of Faith, hee vnder≈øtandeth not Faith indefinitely, but particularly iu≈øtifying Faith. This is euident by his annotation on the twentieth ver≈øe,<note place="margin">In Iam. 2.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Here,</hi> ≈øaith hee,
<hi>is no di≈øputation of the cau≈øe of Iu≈øtification,</hi> whereby what other can hee meane then Iu≈øtifying Faith: And when hee ≈øaith <hi>the di≈øpute is not about Faith,</hi> hee addeth forthwith, <hi>but of a vulgar knowledge which conioyneth a man to God no more then the ≈øight of the Sunne lifts him to Heauen.</hi> Now what is that Faith which vnites vs vnto God, but onely Iu≈øtifying Faith? and what is this vulgar knowledge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Hi≈øtoricall Faith, by which the eye of the mind ≈øees diuine truth as that of the body ≈øees the Sunne?

And <hi>Beza</hi> who vpon this place treadeth in <hi>Caluins</hi> ≈øteps and well knew his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning affirmeth that Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> vnder≈øtandeth not the ≈øame Faith whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith wee are iu≈øtified, but onely that whereby wee doe belieue there is a God, and that Chri≈øt is the Sonne of God, and that all things pre≈øcribed in both the te≈øtaments are true, which is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the very definition of Hi≈øtoricall Faith. But for all your pray≈øing of <hi>Caluin,</hi> you cannot bee contented with his expo≈øition, but you mu≈øt needs haue a tricke beyond him. For whereas hee by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Faith vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand a
<hi>vulgar knowledge,</hi> you will rather haue it to be <hi>a peculiar ≈øhew by miracles,</hi> which is the mo≈øt ≈øen≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe deuice that euer was imagined. For who euer drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the Que≈øtion which there the Apo≈øtle di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ≈øhould bee this, <hi>Whether a peculiar ≈øhew by miracles
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10362:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> without works doe iustifie?</hi> And when hee ≈øaith <hi>Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue≈øt there is one God, thou doest well; the Diuels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue al≈øo and tremble,</hi> what brute of <hi>Cuma</hi> or
<hi>Arcadia</hi> would expound it thus, <hi>Thou ha≈øt a peculiar ≈øhew by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is well, the Diuels haue a peculiar ≈øhew by miracles al≈øo and tremble?</hi> Learne therefore and know that the Faith which Diuels haue, cannot bee Faith of miracles: for miracles the Diuels can worke none, being limited within the compa≈ø≈øe of their nature which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ≈øupernaturall effects, and neuer being ordained to bee the confirmers of Faith, to which end mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were appointed. Now then to end this point, whereas you pray this may ≈øerue for an an≈øwer vnto my fir≈øt di≈øtinction of Hi≈øtoricall Faith, I mu≈øt tell you plainly that what you cannot win by force, you are not like to get by begging; neither can I at any hand bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to accept of friuolous and de≈øperate ≈øpeeches, for ≈øound and ≈øub≈øtantiall an≈øwers.

                     <p>But yet when I ≈øay a man ought to haue A≈ø≈øurance,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10362:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> doe I not therein confe≈ø≈øe it to bee ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation that a man cannot be ≈øaued without it?

Although therefore when I ≈øay a man may bee a≈ø≈øured I confe≈ø≈øe a po≈ø≈øibility, and when I ≈øay hee ought to bee a≈ø≈øured I acknowledge a dutie: yet doth it not follow thereupon that ≈øuch a≈ø≈øurance is of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity. Nece≈ø≈øary it may bee vnto the well-being of the Sonne of God, but not vnto his Being, as if hee could not bee a new creature without it: nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cheere and ≈øolace him in the way to the end, but not vnto the end it ≈øelfe, as if without it hee could not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire vnto ≈øaluation. Such ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of a≈ø≈øurance vpon paine of damnation I know none, ≈øaue onely of tho≈øe truths which wee call fundamentall, among which I ≈øuppo≈øe your and my iu≈øtification and ≈øaluation are not to bee reckoned.

For Saluation is the End, Iu≈øtification a meane or way vnto the End, and more things are ≈øubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vnto the end, then vnto the way: as vnto Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both Faith and workes are nece≈ø≈øary, but vnto Iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication Faith alone is required. And therefore al≈øo it is no ab≈øurdity to ≈øay that two Faiths are requi≈øite vnto Saluation, as indeed Faith of Story and Faith of Per≈øon are, although but one Faith iu≈øtify which is Faith of Per≈øon.

                     <p>The Maior of your fir≈øt Syllogi≈øme that <hi>what≈øoeuer bringeth life eternall bringeth iu≈øtification</hi> I deny. You ≈øay it is plaine becau≈øe <hi>what≈øoeuer apprehendeth the la≈øt ≈øuch as is eternall life, apprehendeth the former al≈øo which is iu≈øtification.</hi> But fir≈øt, what rule of Logicke allowes you thus to ≈øhift tearmes, and to turne bringing of life and iu≈øtification into apprehending life and iu≈øtification? For, how≈øoeuer you ≈øeeme to v≈øe them indifferently, yet are they words of different ≈øignifications: and therefore confounding them thus you make not ≈øo much the truth of the Maior plaine, as ob≈øcure the meaning thereof. Againe, chu≈øe whether of the≈øe tearmes you plea≈øe, yet is it palpably fal≈øe that <hi>What≈øoeuer bringeth or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the la≈øt, bringeth and apprehendeth al≈øo the former.</hi> Rhetoricke brings a man to ≈øpeake eloquently which is the latter: yet it is Grammar not Rhetoricke that brings a man to ≈øpeake <hi>congru√®</hi> which is the former. Phy≈øicke brings a man to the faculty of curing di≈øea≈øes which is the latter: yet brings not to the knowledge of the nature of things; for that belongs vnto the naturall Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and according to the old ≈øaying, where the Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologer ends, there the Phy≈øician begins. So al≈øo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine matters, Hope apprehends eternall life which is the latter, for it is the proper obiect about which it is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: <pb n="88" facs="tcp:10362:53"/> it apprehendeth not iu≈øtification which is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for then by your rule it ≈øhould bee Faith it ≈øelfe, that being faith as you ≈øay which apprehends iu≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As therfore when diuer≈øe needles are by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone trained one after another, the vertue of the ≈øtone moueth the fir≈øt, the fir≈øt the ≈øecond, and ≈øo of the re≈øt, but the third or ≈øecond is no way the cau≈øe of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the fir≈øt: ≈øo in the concatenation of the cau≈øes of our ≈øaluation reckoned vp by the Apo≈øtle, to wit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> Vocation, Iu≈øtification, Glorification, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are mouers as it were vnto the latter, but not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto the former. The rea≈øon of all in a word is this, becau≈øe as I haue already ≈øhewed, more is required vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the maine end, then vnto the ≈øubordinate meanes: and therefore ≈øeeing ≈øaluation is the end, Iu≈øtification the meanes, not what≈øoeuer is requi≈øite vnto that is pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nece≈ø≈øary vnto this.</p>
                     <p>The Minor that <hi>true knowledge of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt bringeth eternall life,</hi> I al≈øo deny. For Particular a≈ø≈øurance (which is the knowledge you mu≈øt here vnder≈øtand, or el≈øe you conclude not to the purpo≈øe) bringeth not eternall life, in as much as a man may be ≈øaued without it, as we haue already ≈øufficiently proued. Neither doe the words of Chri≈øt in <hi>S. Iohn</hi> verify your Minor:<note place="margin">Ioh.
17.3.</note> for by knowledge there he meaneth not your particular a≈ø≈øurance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øion by which a man knowes he is iu≈øtified &amp; ≈øhall be ≈øaued: but ≈øuch a knowledge of Chri≈øt and his Go≈øpell as is mingled with faith, and worketh our wils to accept of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt for our onely mediator. And this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ≈øaid to bee eternall life, not becau≈øe euery one that barely and nakedly knowes liues eternally (for as wee haue ≈øhewed Reprobates and Diuels haue Hi≈øtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb n="89" facs="tcp:10362:53"/> Faith) but partly, becau≈øe no man can liue without it, partly becau≈øe by it the Spirit of God worketh in the Elect that Faith by which they are iu≈øtified and ≈øo come to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>But what ≈øay I vnto the Minor deliuered in other tearmes, thus, <hi>Knowledge of Chri≈øt apprehendeth eternall life?</hi> I ≈øay fir≈øt, it is not the ≈øame Propo≈øition, becau≈øe the tearmes are changed, neither are they equipollent. Secondly, I grant it to bee true, whether you meane by knowledge Dogmaticall Faith or Particular a≈ø≈øurance: for by the one doe we apprehend that there is an eternall life, by the other that wee haue ≈øpeciall intere≈øt in it. Well then, if it apprehendeth eternall life doth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that therefore al≈øo it apprehendeth iu≈øtification? No, by no meanes: for as wee haue aboue demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is not nece≈ø≈øary that that which apprehendeth the latter ≈øhould apprehend the former al≈øo. And yet though I di≈øallow the con≈øequence, the con≈øequent I readily yeeld you, that Particular knowledge apprehendeth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtification: for ≈øo haue wee defined <hi>Faith of promi≈øe to be a per≈øwa≈øion or a≈øsurance that the promi≈øe of God made in Chri≈øt, to wit iustification, remi≈øsion of ≈øinnes, adoption, regeneration, finally, election it ≈øelfe and eternall ≈øaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe particularly pertaine vnto mee and are mine.</hi> What gather you now of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> ≈øay you, it is iu≈øtifying Faith. How ≈øo?
<hi>Becau≈øe what≈øoeuer apprehendeth iu≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is iu≈øtifying Faith.</hi> Nay contrarily what≈øoeuer apprehendeth iu≈øtification it not iu≈øtifying Faith: for apprehen≈øion followeth iu≈øtification, no man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him≈øelfe to bee iu≈øtified vntill hee be iu≈øtified, but Iu≈øtifying Faith is in nature before iu≈øtification, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cau≈øe and this the effect. And therefore vnle≈ø≈øe <pb n="90" facs="tcp:10362:54"/> you will ≈øay that that which followeth is that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before, you cannot ≈øay that that which apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth iu≈øtification is that which iu≈øtifieth.</p>
                     <p>To conclude therefore neither is Faith knowledge nor knowledge Faith, but particular knowledge for ought you haue yet ≈øaid or can ≈øay commeth in time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith. But whereas finally you inferre that Faith is knowledge in the beginning, knowledge in proceeding, knowledge in the end, be≈øides that the foundation vpon which it is grounded is vntrue it is cleane contrary al≈øo to that which erewhile you affirmed, that <hi>Faith is but one, compounded of my three nice di≈øtinctions, the fir≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning, the ≈øecond the progre≈øse, the third the end.</hi> For the third is Faith of Per≈øon, and in the Will, and is by your confe≈ø≈øion there the end of Faith, yet here you ≈øay faith is knowledge in the end: which things how they can ≈øtand together I ≈øee not, vnle≈ø≈øe you will ≈øay that knowledge is in the Will and ≈øo confound the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and operations of the ≈øoule.</p>

But if hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Therefore Faith goeth not before A≈øsurance,</hi> it will al≈øo follow, <hi>Faith goeth not before Charity or good works,</hi> becau≈øe Charity and good works may be in ≈øome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, before Faith actuall bee in the highe≈øt mea≈øure: or thus, The elder Sonne is not borne before the yonger, becau≈øe the yonger may waxe as tall as a Pygmee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the elder bee growne to the ≈øtature of a Giant. Which Con≈øequences if they be ab≈øurd and ridiculous, as ab≈øurd and ridiculous is it to inferre that Faith cannot bee before A≈ø≈øurance, becau≈øe A≈ø≈øurance may bee in ≈øome mea≈øure before Faith bee in the highe≈øt mea≈øure.

The rea≈øon why it may thus be turned is, becau≈øe the Scribes vnder≈øtood Chri≈øt, as if hee him≈øelfe had actually forgiuen the Pal≈øie-man his ≈øins, as appeareth in the ≈øixt and ≈øeuenth ver≈øes, which they could not ≈øo haue conceiued if hee had onely told him that his ≈øinnes were forgiuen him.

                     <p>But to proue that God commands not a Reprobate to belieue you come vpon mee with a mo≈øt mighty and in≈øoluble Enthymem. What is that I be≈øeech you? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this. <hi>A Reprobate if he could belieue, he ≈øhould then without doubt bee ≈øaued:</hi> Ergo, <hi>God doth not command him to Belieue.</hi> A de≈øperate Demon≈øtration I promi≈øe you: for by the ≈øame rea≈øon you may conclude, that God commands him not to obey the Precepts of the Morall law neither, Becau≈øe if hee could keepe them he ≈øhould bee ≈øaued. What you conceiue may bee the knot and ≈øowlder as it were of this Con≈øequence I cannot well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, vnle≈ø≈øe it be one of two, either this, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øeth the Reprobate hee ≈øhall bee ≈øaued if hee Belieue,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> hee commandeth him not to Belieue: or this, The Reprobate cannot belieue, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him not to Belieue, for your words ≈øeeme to bee indifferent either way. If you intend the former, fir≈øt, you contradict your owne ≈øelfe, for in your an≈øwer to the former argument you deny Iu≈øtification and Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="112" facs="tcp:10362:65"/> to bee promi≈øed vpon condition of Faith. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euery <hi>Catechumenus</hi> and Nouice in Diuinity knowes that God vnto Commandement v≈øually annexeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe to draw on Obedience: as in the Couenant of works, fir≈øt hee Commandeth, Doe this and then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øeth, if thou doe it thou ≈øhalt liue; and in the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace al≈øo, fir≈øt hee Commandeth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and then addeth the Promi≈øe, if thou belieue thou ≈øhalt bee ≈øaued. So that Promi≈øe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement exclude not one the other, neither doth it follow, Faith is the condition of a Promi≈øe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not commanded. If you vnder≈øtand the latter, then know that as <hi>Augu≈øtin,</hi> and
<hi>Barnard,</hi> and all Diuines not infected with Pelagiani≈øme ≈øay, God commandeth ≈øome things which man cannot doe, to the end that knowing his owne in≈øufficiency, hee may craue of him the helpe of grace that hee may doe them. And if God doe command any ≈øupernaturall action vnto the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate as without doubt hee doth, then doth hee al≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ≈øome thing aboue his power: for being meerely naturall he cannot produce any ≈øupernaturall operation. Whereupon it followeth euidently that although a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate cannot belieue, yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe hee may bee commanded to Belieue.</p>
                     <p>Well, yet you will proue that a Reprobate cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. To what end? for it is not denied, and you ≈øhould rather ≈øtrengthen your Con≈øequence, and proue that therefore Faith is not commanded. Notwith≈øtanding let vs heare your rea≈øon, for it ≈øeemeth to bee very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. <hi>That hee cannot Belieue,</hi> ≈øay you, <hi>the rea≈øon is, Chri≈øt hath not wa≈øhed him.</hi> If you had ≈øaid as followeth, Chri≈øt hath not opened his heart to Belieue, or, it is to <pb n="113" facs="tcp:10362:65"/> bee imputed to the hardnes of his owne heart, and had ≈øtopt there, I ≈øhould ea≈øily haue yeelded vnto you: but now that you ≈øay the <hi>rea≈øon is becau≈øe Chri≈øt hath not wa≈øhed him,</hi> I mu≈øt needs tell you it is vnrea≈øonable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, for it implies that wee are fir≈øt wa≈øhed and then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, whereas both Scripture and the analogie of Faith teach vs that we fir≈øt belieue and then afterward are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed. Search the booke of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28. Act. 15.9. Rom. 3.25.</note> and there ≈øhall you read, that wee are iu≈øtified by Faith, that the heart is purified by Faith, that God hath ≈øet forth Ie≈øus Chri≈øt to bee a reconciliation through Faith in his Blood.

<hi>if thou belieue not, Chri≈øt de≈øcended not for thee, Chri≈øt ≈øuffered not for thee.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4.

The≈øe two Propo≈øitions are contradictory, The Reprobate is iu≈øtified, The Reprobate is not iu≈øtified: and, The Reprobate ≈øhall bee ≈øaued, The Reprobate ≈øhall not bee ≈øaued. God therefore cannot make that they ≈øhould be true at once. For as Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> ≈øaith,<note place="margin">Contr√† Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtum Man. l. 26. c. 5.</note>
                        <hi>Who≈øoeuer ≈øaith, if God bee omnipotent, let him make that tho≈øe things which haue been haue not been, ≈øees not that he faith, if God be omnipotent, let him make that tho≈øe things which are true in that they are true be fal≈øe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. One part of the Contradiction is nece≈ø≈øarily fal≈øe namely this, The Reprobate is iu≈øtified,<note place="margin">Rom.
8.30.</note> The Reprobate ≈øhall bee ≈øaued: for they onely who are Prede≈øtinated vnto life, are as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, effectually called, and they onely who are effectually called are iu≈øtified and ≈øhall bee glorified. And if it were po≈ø≈øible that they ≈øhould bee ≈øaued, then were there change in the vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable decree of God which hath finally reiected them, which is impo≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.

For according to that infallible maxime, <hi>Fal≈øhood is not vnder Faith:</hi> and therefore if the Obiect bee Fal≈øhood it is not Faith which apprehendeth it for true, if it bee Faith Fal≈øhood is not the Obiect thereof. So that hee which commands that fal≈øe Propo≈øition to bee belieued, makes that to bee Faith which cannot beare the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, and that to bee the Obiect which is not the Obiect thereof, that is as I ≈øaid makes Faith to bee error, and Fal≈øhood Truth, which are contradictories.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. God therefore neither doth nor can ≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: neither is it impure or impious to affirme ≈øo much, being in the Word of God ≈øo manife≈øtly reuealed.

                     <p n="9">9. But this opinion, that Faith is an A≈ø≈øurance, infers this bla≈øphemous ab≈øurdity. For as I haue ≈øhewed, God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mands all men, euen Reprobates to belieue now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue as you ≈øay is to bee a≈ø≈øured of iu≈øtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God commands the Reprobate to be a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Iu≈øtification and Saluation, which is ab≈øurd.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Ab≈øurd therefore is that opinion that Faith is A≈ø≈øurance which infers it. For from truth no ab≈øurdity or bla≈øphemie but onely truth can follow.

                     <p>Here, <hi>Master Baxter,</hi> and in the re≈øt of your an≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers <pb n="137" facs="tcp:10362:77"/> in≈øuing, you waue &amp; flote vp and downe like a boat in a ≈øtorme without a Pilote, an≈øwering tumultuarily what euer comes next to head, and ≈øcorning like another <hi>Ca≈ø≈øius Seuerus</hi> to keep either in method your matter,<note place="margin">Tacit. vel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti√πs Quintil. de cau≈ø≈ø. cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. eloq.</note> or mode≈øtie in your words. But as you lead the dance, ≈øo mu≈øt I needs follow. Thus therefore you argue.
<hi>No man can be damned hauing iu≈øtifying Faith, A man may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned re≈øting his will vpon Chri≈øt &amp; his merits,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Re≈øting of the will vpon Chri≈øt and his merits is not iu≈øtifying Faith:</hi> The Maior I grant, the Minor thus you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>Hee that wanteth ≈øanctification may bee damned, A man re≈øting his will vpon Chri≈øt and his merits may want ≈øanctification,</hi> Ergo, <hi>a man re≈øting his will vpon Chri≈øt and his merits may be damned.</hi> The Maior againe I grant, if you vnder≈øtand it either thus, <hi>Hee that finally wanteth ≈øanctification ≈øhall bee damned,</hi> or thus, <hi>Hee that wanteth pre≈øent ≈øanctification is for the pre≈øent in the ≈øtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> for otherwi≈øe the Elect vntill their effectuall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation want ≈øanctification, and yet ≈øhall neuer actually be damned. The Minor you barely affirme but confirme not: thinking it as it ≈øeemes proofe inough if you ≈øay it and ≈øub≈øcribe thereunto Witne≈ø≈øe our ≈øelfe: vnto this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument therefore I an≈øwer two things.</p>

For in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe thus I obiected again≈øt my ≈øelfe, <hi>If Faith be Affiance then the wicked may haue it: for Balaam de≈øired to die the death of the Righteous, and ≈øome receiue the Word with ioy belieuing for a time.</hi> And vnto this obiection in the ≈øame <pb n="138" facs="tcp:10362:78"/> Treati≈øe I gaue a ≈øufficient and full ≈øolution, di≈øtingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betweene that Affiance which is ≈øleight and ≈øuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and that which is ≈øetled and grounded, as there you may read more at large, for thither I referre you. But becau≈øe,<note place="margin">Hecub. act. 2.</note> as <hi>Euripides</hi> ≈øaith, the ≈øame ≈øpeech ≈øpoken by diuer≈øe per≈øons is not alike entertained: peraduenture this an≈øwer would be better accepted if you might haue it from the mouth of greater authority. Read then <hi>M.

<hi>which is ≈øuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of A≈øsurance may bee the Act of Faith.</hi> If you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the latter, then doe I grant the Maior: for if ≈øuch A≈ø≈øurance be (as I haue demon≈øtratiuely proued) it ≈øelfe the Effect of Faith, it is more then manife≈øt that, <hi>That which is an effect of ≈øuch A≈ø≈øurance cannot bee the Act of Faith.</hi> But then I deny the Minor, that

                     <p>But, what re≈øt, ≈øay you, can a man haue vpon Chri≈øt, without A≈ø≈øurance to be ≈øaued by his Death &amp; Pa≈ø≈øion? Surely vnle≈ø≈øe wee know his Death and Pa≈ø≈øion to bee the onely meanes of ≈øaluation, wee cannot re≈øt vpon him for it: but to ≈øay, that a man cannot re≈øt vpon him for ≈øaluation, vnle≈ø≈øe hee know that hee is already tran≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life, is a mo≈øt vnrea≈øonable and ≈øen≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe ≈øpeech, as if a man might not tru≈øt vnto his friend to doe ≈øomething for him, vntill he were ≈øure, it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done.

                     <p>Thus you rea≈øon, Faith is a labour, Re≈øt is not a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is not a Re≈øt. The Maior you proue thus, That which worketh re≈øt is a labour, But Faith worketh re≈øt and cea≈øeth when re≈øt is wrought, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is a labour. The Minor you leaue naked and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe, ≈øuppo≈øing I thinke that no man vnle≈ø≈øe bereft of his fiue wits would deny it, and hold that Re≈øt is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Let vs therefore briefly examine them both. The Maior of your ≈øecond Syllogi≈øme preci≈øely and literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder≈øtood is not true: for that which worketh is the Agent or Labourer, and the Labourer cannot bee the Action or Labour. Whereupon it followeth, If that which worketh bee not a labour, And Faith as you a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume worke, that therefore Faith is not a labor which is contradictory vnto the Maior of your fir≈øt Syllogy≈øme. And yet as I grant not vnto you that Faith is a labour, ≈øo neither dare I peremptorily deny it: only I blame you for ≈øpeaking ≈øo confu≈øedly where it was nece≈ø≈øary to v≈øe di≈øtinction. Know therefore that Faith as all other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities whether acquired or infu≈øed may bee con≈øidered two wayes, either in the fir≈øt act, (as Schooles v≈øe to ≈øpeake) or in the ≈øecond. The fir≈øt act is the very habit of Faith inhering and ≈øticking in the ≈øoule: the ≈øecond is the immediate and proper operation and action thereof. If then you vnder≈øtand Faith in the fir≈øt Act, and as it is an Habit, it is not a labour, but is imprinted in vs by the Holy Gho≈øt, to the end that when oportunity is offered, and duty requireth, wee may by vertue thereof more ≈øweetly, readily, and ea≈øily worke, and labour. And ≈øo <pb n="149" facs="tcp:10362:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> far is it from being a labor it ≈øelfe, that oftentimes it lieth as it were idle &amp; a≈øleep doing nothing at all vntill it plea≈øe the Spirit of God to ≈øtirre vp our wils, and to quicken the ≈øparke hee hath put in vs, inabling vs thereby to coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him. But if you vnder≈øtand Faith in the ≈øecond Act, and as it is in operation and action, then may you iu≈øtly call it a labour: for as our Sauiour ≈øaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.29.</note> to belieue in him whom the Father hath ≈øent is a Worke which God requireth vs to doe, in regard whereof the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the Worke of Faith.<note place="margin">1 The≈ø≈ø. 1.3.</note> And becau≈øe Faith iu≈øtifieth, not as it is in the fir≈øt, but in the ≈øecond act, that is not as it is an Habit, but as it is in action, accepting and applying vnto vs Chri≈øt and his merits, hence is it, ≈øaith <hi>Bucer,</hi> that Prote≈øtants v≈øually define it by a motion.<note place="margin">De iu≈øtific.</note> Let the Maior therefore in this ≈øen≈øe bee granted vnto you.</p>
                     <p>The Minor which you thinke to bee ≈øo cock≈øure I flatly deny, confidently affirming that Re≈øt is a labour: prouided, you vnder≈øtand no other Re≈øt then that which in my Treati≈øe I haue expre≈ø≈øed and declared. For if by Re≈øt you meane Quiet, ≈øuch Re≈øt without all que≈øtion is not Labour: for it is the end of labour, and a ce≈ø≈øation from it, and therefore well did you ≈øay that, <hi>when eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall re≈øt is wrought, then the labour of Faith cea≈øeth.</hi> But you cannot bee ignorant, that by Re≈øt I vnder≈øtand not Quiet, but Affiance, in as much as I render the Latin word <hi>Fiducia</hi> by it, and make the Act thereof to bee
<hi>Inniti,</hi> which (as I haue ≈øhewed in ≈øome of our Engli≈øh tran≈ølations) is oftentimes turned by Re≈øting and Staying vpon. And this Re≈øt, that is, this Relying, this Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, this Tru≈øting or Belieuing on Chri≈øt, is not a Quiet, but a motion or operation, and therefore a labour. True it is that who≈øoeuer commeth vnto Chri≈øt, and ≈øetteth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10362:84"/> his whole Affiance vpon him, ≈øhall thereby finde refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Quiet vnto his ≈øoule: yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that Affiance it ≈øelfe, is an act or motion of the Will, and not a Quiet, euen as the inclination of a mans ≈øelfe vpon his ≈øtaffe, or the laying of him downe vpon his bed is an action of the body. In a word remember what a little before I haue deliuered to cleare this tearme from all ambiguity, and take it in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe which there I giue vnto it, and vnle≈ø≈øe you will ≈øay<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that light is darkne≈ø≈øe you cannot but confe≈ø≈øe that ≈øuch re≈øt is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ≈øo that notwith≈øtanding this argument, Faith may be a Re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But now giue mee leaue to take vp the weapon which you are forced to lay downe, and to trie whether a blow therewith from my arme will pearce any deeper: for thus I retort your owne rea≈øon again≈øt you.
<hi>Faith is rather a labour then a re≈øt, A≈ø≈øurance is not ≈øo, but rather a re≈øt then a labour,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Faith is not A≈øsurance.</hi> The Maior is your owne, and you may not deny it. The Minor I proue thus,
<hi>Intellection or knowledge,</hi> ≈øaith Ari≈øtotle, <hi>is more like vnto re≈øt and quiet then vnto motion:</hi> for although the mind while it is inquiring &amp; ≈øeeking for knowledge is euer in motion and ≈øo laboureth, yet when the Habit of knowledge is once acquired and gotten, then is there no farther motion of the vnder≈øtanding thereunto, but a ≈øweet re≈øt and Quiet therein. Whereupon ≈øaith the ≈øame Philo≈øopher, <hi>By the quieting &amp; ≈øetling of the ≈øoule, doth a man become intelligent and wi≈øe,</hi> meaning by Quiet, as <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> expoundeth him,<note place="margin">Exerc. in Card. 307. 13.</note> nothing el≈øe but the a≈ø≈øent of the minde. I a≈ø≈øume, <hi>But A≈ø≈øurance is ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection or knowledge,</hi> for it is an <hi>habituall a≈ø≈øent</hi> vnto this truth, that wee are in the pre≈øent ≈øtate of grace and <pb n="151" facs="tcp:10362:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> ≈øhall infallibly bee ≈øaued. Wherefore I conclude that <hi>A≈øsurance is rather a re≈øt or quiet then a labour:</hi> whence al≈øo it farther followeth that <hi>Faith,</hi> being as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe <hi>rather a labour, then a re≈øt,</hi> cannot be <hi>A≈øsurance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, Faith, you ≈øay, cea≈øeth when eternall pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and re≈øt is wrought. I grant: for the Obiect of Faith, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, are things which are not ≈øeene, whereupon Saint

                        <hi>Si vides non e≈øt Fides,</hi> Beholding is not Belieuing.

I a≈ø≈øume then, <hi>But A≈øsurance cea≈øeth not when eternall pacification and rest is wrought:</hi> for then the certainty of our Election, of our adoption, of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation into grace, and finally of our Saluation is ≈øo farre from cea≈øing, that it is by ≈øo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto vs, as intuitiue apprehen≈øion and the ≈øight of the eye is more infallible then heare-≈øay or ≈øeeing by reflexion.

E≈øpecially ≈øeeing hee ≈øhall then cea≈øe to bee vnto vs a Mediator of Redemption and Reconciliation, in regard whereof only hee is the Obiect of Affiance or Iu≈øtifying Faith, and ≈øhall bee vnto vs no otherwi≈øe then he is vnto the Elect Angels, a Mediatour of Con≈øeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confirme &amp; pre≈øerue vs eternally in the mo≈øt ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed ≈øtate of glory.

                     <p>Iu≈øtification is a law-tearme, and is oppo≈øed vnto Condemnation.

Now there are three barres at which all men are arraigned, and three Iudges, who at their ≈øeuerall barres either iu≈øtify vs, or condemne vs, that is to ≈øay, the barre of God, the barre of Con≈øcience, and the barre of Men.

On the contrary ≈øide, if men condemne vs, it mattereth not, ≈øo as our Con≈øcience doe ab≈øolue vs: and if our Con≈øcience al≈øo doe condemne vs, yet happy are we, if God ab≈øolue vs, for God is greater then our Con≈øcience.

God iu≈øtifieth vs at his barre when hee ≈øeeth our Faith, that by firme Affiance wee re≈øt and rely our ≈øelues vpon Chri≈øt to bee our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, accepting him to bee our Prophet, Prie≈øt, and King: for then according vnto promi≈øe doth hee accept the Pa≈ø≈øiue obedience of Chri≈øt to ≈øatisfy for our ≈øinnes pa≈øt, and imputeth vnto vs his Actiue obedience to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of that perfect legall righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe which ≈øhould be in vs. Our Con≈øcience iu≈øtifies vs at his barre, when it is per≈øwaded that God hath already iu≈øtified vs: for as long as it is per≈øwaded that God condemneth, it cannot acquit vs. If the per≈øwa≈øion of the Con≈øcience be built vpon a ≈øandy and deceitfull foundation, it is rather vaine pre≈øumption then true a≈ø≈øurance, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it giueth is erronious: but if it bee grounded vpon infallible euidence, euen the te≈øtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> witne≈ø≈øing with our ≈øpirits that wee are the <pb n="173" facs="tcp:10362:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> ≈øons of God, then is the A≈ø≈øurance ≈øound and certaine, and the ≈øentence pronounced thereupon iu≈øt and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note> whence pre≈øently ari≈øeth in our ≈øoules ≈øuch vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable peace as pa≈ø≈øeth all vnder≈øtanding, and ≈øuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ioy as nothing can take from vs. Finally, Men iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtify vs at their barre al≈øo,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.22.

5.16.</note> when our light ≈øo ≈øhineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, that they ≈øee our good works, which are the fruits of Faith and a good Con≈øcience, and thereby are moued to glorify our Heauenly Father: as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded in the iudgement of Charity that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as they ≈øeeme to bee, euen iu≈øtified before God, and borne againe of water and the Holy Gho≈øt. This iudgement becau≈øe it is built vpon probability onely, and not vpon certainty (for who knowes whether the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance come from the inward holyne≈ø≈øe or hollowne≈ø≈øe of the heart, but onely the heart it ≈øelfe, and God which made it?) May therefore bee erronious, and though proceeding from Charity, yet in the meane ≈øea≈øon ≈øwaruing from verity. If then when Men iu≈øtify vs, our owne Con≈øciences tell vs, that they pronounce a wrong ≈øentence, and ab≈øolue the guilty: the comfort that growes vnto vs thereby is no better then a cup of cold water is vnto a man ≈øicke of a burning feuer, or then the <hi>Sardonian</hi> laughter which makes the face ≈øeeme to grin, while the deadly poi≈øon is ≈øearching through eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry veine, and ≈øeazing vpon the very heart. But if wee bee well a≈ø≈øured that the ≈øentence is iu≈øt and true, and that they are not deceiued therein, although it bee not the end wee aymed at, nor the Crowne wee looked for, yet is it a ≈øweet and amiable companion of holy life, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickely te≈øtifying vnto our great comfort that God hath been glorified by vs, our profe≈ø≈øion honoured, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10362:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> others inuited if not gained vnto Chri≈øt. And thus much haue I thought good in regard of your ≈øilence to ≈øpeake I hope not impertinently, at lea≈øt wi≈øe not vnprofitably of Iu≈øtification: the ≈øumme whereof is that Affiance iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifies before God, A≈ø≈øurance before Con≈øience, works before Men. So that I doe not ≈øimply deny either that A≈ø≈øurance is Faith (for in my Treati≈øe I acknowledge that the Scripture ≈øometime calleth it Faith) or that it iu≈øtifieth (for I confe≈ø≈øe it iu≈øtifieth at the barre of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience) onely I deny it to bee that Faith which iu≈øtifies before God, affirming that Faith to bee no other then Affiance.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, when <hi>Infants</hi> are pre≈øented at the holy Font, and either ≈øprinkled with the water of <hi>Bapti≈øme,</hi> or dipped therein: how chanceth it that they ≈øo much di≈ølike thereof, te≈øtifying their di≈ølike by their crying and other motion of the body? Certainly, had they <hi>actuall Faith,</hi> they would endure all with much patience and cheerefulne≈ø≈øe, and neuer bewray ≈øo much aduer≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and di≈øcontent. But if in doing ≈øo they goe again≈øt their knowledge, the

                     </gap>rre from auailing them to the wa≈øhing away of
<hi>Originall</hi> guilt, that by their reluctation they rather contract a further guilt of <hi>Actuall ≈øinne,</hi> which I ≈øuppo≈øe none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be too too vncharitable will imagine of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they haue <hi>Faith,</hi> why are they not after their initiation by <hi>Bapti≈øme,</hi> forthwith admitted vnto holy
<hi>Communion?</hi> In the time of Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> and
<hi>Innocent</hi> the fir≈øt, it was the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> ≈øo to <pb n="196" facs="tcp:10362:107"/> doe: and it continued, as ≈øome write, for the ≈øpace of ≈øixe hundred yeeres, downe vnto the times of <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Lotharius.</hi> But why is that cu≈øtome now growne out of v≈øe, and why are Children barred from the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> if they belieue as well as elder people? Nay why are they not rather admitted then tho≈øe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per yeeres? For <hi>Infants</hi> haue not ≈øo much as euill thoughts in them: but the≈øe by rea≈øon of their longer life haue made them≈øelues guilty of many euill deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witne≈ø≈øeth,
<hi>commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God preached.</hi> But
<hi>Infants</hi> heare not, neither by the eare, nor by any other way proportionable thereunto: or if they doe, yet they vnder≈øtand not what they heare. For did they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, I pre≈øume they would harken more attentiuely vnto what is ≈øaid, then we ≈øee they doe. Wherefore not hearing, neither doe they belieue. If you ≈øay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue by an inward
<hi>Hearing:</hi> then is that <hi>Faith</hi> wrought either by
<hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary</hi> meanes. Not by
<hi>Extraordinary</hi> meanes, for it is done euery day and houre. By
<hi>Ordinary</hi> therefore. If ≈øo, then haue wee a double manner of working
<hi>Faith,</hi> and both of them <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:</hi> the one by <hi>Inward Hearing</hi> in <hi>Infants</hi> only, the other by <hi>Inward</hi> and
<hi>Outward</hi> al≈øo in tho≈øe that are <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> which is a meere nouelty in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, how commeth it to pa≈ø≈øe, if Children haue Faith, that among ≈øo many millions of them as haue beene in the world, not ≈øo much as one of them when they come to riper yeares, giueth any te≈øtimony of his
<hi>Faith</hi> vntill hee bee farther taught and informed? If a child borne of Chri≈øtian parents, and entred into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10362:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church by Bapti≈øme, ≈øhall afterwards while hee is yet in his tender yeeres fall into the hands of <hi>Infidels</hi> or
<hi>Turks,</hi> (as the more the pitie many thou≈øands of them haue done, and the whole band of <hi>Ianizars</hi>), they ≈øay, con≈øi≈øts of no other: doth hee not readily receiue that religion, which is fir≈øt in≈øtilled into him, without once dreaming of the <hi>Chri≈øtian Faith?</hi> Which yet how it ≈øhould bee, hauing from his fir≈øt infancy beene ≈øea≈øoned and ≈øanctified with the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> cannot ea≈øily be conceiued or imagined.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, tell mee, doe all that haue receiued <hi>Faith</hi> in their infancy loo≈øe it againe when they come to bee of more yeeres? It ≈øeemeth ≈øo, if then they receiued it: for otherwi≈øe, why are they put to their <hi>Catechi≈øme,</hi> and taught the elements of <hi>Faith</hi> againe? But this were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øtrange cour≈øe: For how ≈øhould they loo≈øe it? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe perhaps God ≈øecretly ≈øteale that from them which ear≈øt he gaue them: which to ≈øay, is very derogatory to the bounty of God, who neuer withdraweth grace once giuen, vntill man by abu≈øing it haue de≈øerued to loo≈øe it. Not loo≈øing it therefore, and yet learning it when they come to yeeres of capacity, It is a plaine argument they neuer receiued it in their
<hi>Infancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly and la≈øtly, there is not the lea≈øt Habit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquired by cu≈øtome, or infu≈øed from aboue but maketh a man more apt and prone vnto their proper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For example, who≈øoeuer is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Iu≈øtice, Temperance, Liberality, Fortitude,</hi> will readily doe iu≈øtly, temperatly, liberally, valiantly: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of
<hi>Habits</hi> to facilitate <hi>Actions.</hi> Tell mee then, are the Children of Chri≈øtians when they come fir≈øt to be in≈øtructed more capable of Chri≈øtian Religion, <pb n="198" facs="tcp:10362:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> or more inclinable to holy actions, then the Children of <hi>Infidels?</hi> Experience tels vs they are not, but are as waxe indifferently flexible any way. It is ab≈øurd therefore and void of rea≈øon to place in <hi>Infants</hi> the Habit of <hi>Faith,</hi> which yet inclines them no more to the Acts of <hi>Faith,</hi> then tho≈øe that are without it.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing thus briefly demon≈øtrated that <hi>Infants</hi> haue neither <hi>Actuall</hi> nor <hi>Habituall Faith:</hi> it followeth in the next place to an≈øwer the contrary arguments aboue ≈øet downe. And fir≈øt where it is ≈øaid, that <hi>Faith</hi> is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary meanes vnto
<hi>Iu≈øtification</hi> and <hi>Saluation,</hi> in as much as none can plea≈øe God or liue without it: I an≈øwer in a word, it is to bee vnder≈øtood not of <hi>Infants;</hi> But <hi>de Adultis</hi> of tho≈øe that are of riper yeeres, vnto whom alone <hi>Faith</hi> is nece≈ø≈øary. The≈øe cannot plea≈øe God, nor liue, nor bee iu≈øtified and ≈øaued without a particular <hi>Faith</hi> of their owne: but <hi>Infants</hi> by rea≈øon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity through the indulgence of God may. Adde hereunto, that according to the <hi>Tenent</hi> of our <hi>Diuines,</hi> it is not the
<hi>Habit</hi> but the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> that doth iu≈øtify: in regard whereof they define it by a <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> grounded vpon an a≈ø≈øent of the <hi>Mind</hi> vnto the truth of the Go≈øpell. Vnle≈ø≈øe therefore, you grant vnto <hi>Infants</hi> ≈øuch a motion both of the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> which <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> expre≈øly deny, and <hi>Lutherans</hi> ≈øeeme to ≈øtagger at, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they bee iu≈øtified by <hi>Actuall Faith,</hi> hauing none. And ≈øeeing without it the <hi>Habit</hi> auailes nothing at all, as being an idle
<hi>Faith:</hi> I ≈øee not to what end the Habit ≈øhould bee infu≈øed. And if it bee to no end, neither is it infu≈øed. For if <hi>Nature</hi> doe not, much le≈ø≈øe doth God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in vaine.</p>

<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> haue neither <hi>Actuall</hi> nor <hi>Habituall Faith</hi> of their owne, how then and by what meanes are they <hi>Iu≈øtified</hi> and

<hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epi≈øt. 77.</note>

In which words of
<hi>Bernard,</hi> two excellent rea≈øons are rendred, why the <hi>Faith</hi> of another through the grace and indulgence of God ≈øhould bee auailable vnto them: the fir≈øt becau≈øe their <hi>Jnfancy</hi> denies vnto them a proper
<hi>Faith</hi> of their owne, the ≈øecond becau≈øe be≈øides that
<hi>Originall Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> traduced into them from their parents without their knowledge or con≈øent, they haue no other ≈øinne of their owne. Can they not then by rea≈øon of their tender yeeres haue a <hi>Faith</hi> of their owne? It befits the goodnes <pb n="201" facs="tcp:10362:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God that they bee holpen by the <hi>Faith</hi> of another. Haue they no proper and particular ≈øinne of their owne<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Neither doth God thinke it agreeable with his iu≈øtice to exact of them a proper and particular Faith of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Infants then are holpen by anothers <hi>Faith.</hi> Who≈øe
<hi>Faith</hi> will you ≈øay? The <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Parents,</hi> as al≈øo of the <hi>Church,</hi> who is the common mother of vs all, and in who≈øe wombe as it were they are conceiued &amp; borne. This of old was Saint
<hi>Augu≈øtins</hi> ≈øentence, and this all ≈øound Diuines haue agreeably with the <hi>Scripture</hi> euer held. Onely it may be demanded how and in what ≈øort the <hi>Parents Faith</hi> auaileth them. Whereunto I an≈øwer, not by particular applying of Chri≈øts merits and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto them (for this is done onely by a mans owne <hi>Faith</hi> vnto him≈øelfe) but by bringing them within the compa≈ø≈øe of the <hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> Thus; The

<hi>Children</hi> al≈øo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For as it is in ciuill negotiations, the bargaine that the Father maketh for him≈øelfe &amp; his Children is firme and good, although the <hi>Children</hi> bee not pre≈øent at the bargaine-making, nor vnder≈øtand what is done: euen ≈øo in this ≈øpirituall Couenant and contract with God, the <hi>Parents Act</hi> is ≈øufficient force to confederate their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> al≈øo, and to giue them a right vnto all the benefits of the <hi>Couenant.</hi> And as I conceiue, this is imputed vnto them in lieu of all tho≈øe <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe are required in tho≈øe that are <hi>Adulti.</hi> How farther

Onely I affirme that by the Faith of the <hi>Parents</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> are made a holy ≈øeed, and members of Chri≈øts body.</p>
                  <p>But what if one of the <hi>Parents</hi> bee an

Cor. 7.14.</note> So ≈øaith Saint <hi>Paul, The vnbelieuing husband is ≈øanctified by the belieuing wife, and the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing wife is ≈øanctified by the husband: el≈øe were your Children vncleane, but now are they holy.</hi> Againe, though neither of the <hi>Parents</hi> belieue with iu≈øtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> yet being in the Church by the profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, their Children are within the <hi>Couenant.</hi> For fir≈øt, <hi>the Soule that ≈øinneth it ≈øhall die:</hi>

                     <hi>they are conceiued and borne in ≈øinne,</hi> and ≈øo the <hi>Children of Wrath:</hi> but you are to know that they repre≈øent a double per≈øon, one of a Sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the other of one ingrafted into Chri≈øt.

<hi>Saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Parents</hi> may hence learne that a nece≈ø≈øity is laid vpon them to pre≈øent their <hi>Children</hi> vnto the holy Font, ≈øo ≈øoone as conueniently they may. For ≈øeeing by their birth they are intere≈øted vnto the <hi>Couenant,</hi> the ≈øeale of the <hi>Couenant</hi> mu≈øt not in any ca≈øe be ≈øleighted or neglected. What though
<hi>Bapti≈øme</hi> be not ab≈øolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary vnto them? yet is it nece≈ø≈øary for <hi>Parents</hi> to giue it them conditionally, if it may bee had. If it cannot bee had, the <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>De≈øire</hi> of the
<hi>Parents</hi> is ≈øufficient: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the bare want of
<hi>Bapti≈øme</hi> without any of his or their default, exclude the
<hi>Child</hi> from <hi>Saluation.</hi> For if a iu≈øt and hone≈øt man would, much more will God performe his Word and <hi>Couenant,</hi> although the ≈øeale be not ≈øet thereunto. But if it may bee had, there is

<hi>Adulti;</hi> and therefore if then they neglect
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10362:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be baptized, they de≈øerue for their contempt to bee cut off and to bee eternally condemned. But <hi>Infants</hi> while ≈øuch are none of the≈øe Sonnes, as being both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the precept, and vnable to offer them≈øelues vnto the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> whence followeth that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement taketh hold onely of the Parents, and tho≈øe that haue the care of them. So that although the <hi>Child</hi> dying vnbaptized may bee free from danger: yet tho≈øe that neglect to pre≈øent him vnto <hi>Bapti≈øme</hi> ≈øhall bee damned for breach of Gods commandement.

                  <p>Finally and la≈øtly, ≈øeeing euery one that is
<hi>Adultus</hi> mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity haue a <hi>Faith</hi> of his owne, fir≈øt it is the duty of <hi>Parents</hi> by all meanes to worke

<hi>Conference</hi> I had with you. Would you but vouch≈øafe to vi≈øit my poore Cottage, I ≈øhould readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ≈øatisfy ≈øome part of the debt, if not with like entertainment, yet with equall <pb n="214" facs="tcp:10362:117"/> welcome. The re≈øidue I know not how better to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, then by pur≈øuing my fir≈øt intention; that is, by labouring to reduce you backe into the bo≈øome of that <hi>Church,</hi> out of which with ≈øuch danger to your ≈øoule, ≈øcandall to the brethren, and vnkindne≈ø≈øe to her you haue withdrawne your ≈øelfe. And to this end might I haue obtained from you in writing, as at our parting I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what tho≈øe ≈øpeciall
<hi>Motiues</hi> were which had wrought in you this ≈øudden change: I would haue ≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ≈øelfe by writing al≈øo to haue giuen them the be≈øt ≈øatisfaction. But ≈øeeing for rea≈øons be≈øt knowne to your ≈øelfe, and into which I li≈øt not further to inquire, you held it not fit as then to yeeld ≈øo farre vnto mee: I haue thought good for the pre≈øent to reflect vpon ≈øome pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages of our <hi>Conference,</hi> ≈øpecially that ground whereon you then ≈øtood ≈øo much, and vpon which you plainely profe≈ø≈øed that you would aduenture your <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may plea≈øe you therefore to remember that being demaunded a rea≈øon of your departure, you pretended that in reading the ancient
<hi>Fathers</hi> you had met with ≈øundry <hi>Bugbeares,</hi> which ≈øo ≈øcared and affrighted you, that vnle≈ø≈øe you would re≈øi≈øt the light of
<hi>Con≈øcience,</hi> and hazard your eternall ≈øaluation, you could not chu≈øe but bee ≈øwayed by them. Whereunto it being replied, that happily tho≈øe <hi>Bugbeares</hi> were but <hi>Scarcrowes,</hi> and that you ≈øhould haue taken a ≈øafer and ≈øurer cour≈øe, if you had re≈øolued your Faith into Scriptures, nothing being ≈øufficient to beare vp ≈øo weighty a peece but onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine te≈øtimony: your an≈øwer was that vpon Scripture you relyed, howbeit, becau≈øe it is ob≈øcure and ≈øubiect to manifold con≈øtructions, vpon Scripture vnder≈øtood according to the interpretation and doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <pb n="215" facs="tcp:10362:117"/> nothing doubting but that as long as you held the Faith of them whom wee verily belieue to bee ≈øaued, your ≈øelfe could neuer peri≈øh through misbeliefe. In which an≈øwer, how≈øoeuer in word you ≈øeeme to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ≈øome force and vertue to the Scriptures, yet in truth you doe but cancell them and make them of none effect. For if the Scriptures lie rather in the Sen≈øe then in the Letter, and the Sen≈øe by rea≈øon of the darkne≈ø≈øe and ambiguity of them, bee not to bee found in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, but el≈øewhere out of them, in the writings of the Fathers: it followeth clearely that in your account <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other Pen-men of holy writ are no better then <hi>Cyphers,</hi> vnle≈ø≈øe <hi>Cyrill</hi> and
<hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> and the re≈øt of that ranke as digit numbers vouch≈øafe to adde ≈øome value and ≈øignification vnto them. So that now by your fauor this mu≈øt bee my taske briefly and plainely to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate, that hauing remoued your Faith from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture vpon the expo≈øition of the Fathers, you haue built quite be≈øide the rocke, and layd your foundation vpon the ≈øand.</p>
                  <p>But take this prote≈øtation fir≈øt, that wee neither di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øteeme nor de≈øpi≈øe the Fathers, as by Prie≈øts and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuites wee are ordinarily ≈ølandered: but contrarywi≈øe, with all duty wee ri≈øe vp to their gray haires, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their venerable antiquity. Withall wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they were in their times excellent ornaments and lights of the Church, endued not onely with ≈øingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge in the my≈øtery of Faith, but al≈øo with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ≈øanctity and vprightne≈ø≈øe of life. Whereby, in all their combats and bickerins with Hereticks, they maintained the truth of God ≈øo wi≈øely and couragiou≈øly, <pb n="216" facs="tcp:10362:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they euer remained more then conquerors. And now as they haue left behind them a pretious name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints ≈øo wee doubt not but their ≈øoules are bound vp in the bundle of life, and enioy the ble≈ø≈øed: making vi≈øion of God for euermore. Such books of theirs as are come to our hands we e≈øteeme as rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, and value them aboue gold. Them doe wee ≈øearch and peru≈øe with all diligence: bee it ≈øpoken without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no Papi≈øts more. Yet can wee not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them meet with tho≈øe terrible
<hi>Bugbears</hi> you ≈øo much complain of: rather wee wonder how you could mi≈ø≈øe all tho≈øe good Angels ≈øo frequently appearing in them to comfirme and ≈øettle you in your fir≈øt Faith. For I wil bee bold to ≈øay, notwith≈øtanding all the brags and crakes of that ≈øide, that the Fathers are ours not yours: or if they bee yours in any thing, it is in the pettie≈øt and ≈ømalle≈øt matters, for in the maine and great que≈øtions controuerted between vs, they are expre≈øly for vs and again≈øt you, as hereafter God willing ≈øhall in part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.

                  <p>To proceed, the Scriptures you ≈øay are ob≈øcure and ambiguous, and therefore you may not re≈øt vpon them ≈øaue onely as they are expounded of the Fathers. If ≈øo, then if the Fathers al≈øo bee ob≈øcure and ambiguous, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may you re≈øt your Faith vpon them. Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fathers are as darke and doubtfull as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If you thinke otherwi≈øe, doe but read the works <pb n="236" facs="tcp:10362:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> of
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and let me afterward know your minde. For my part I ≈øee no rea≈øon why the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ≈øhould bee more ≈øubiect to diuer≈øity of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the difference of times, as <hi>Cardinall Cu≈øan</hi> impiou≈øly affirmeth,<note place="margin">Ep. 2. &amp; 7.

<hi>Duraeus</hi> the Ie≈øuit impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently defendeth; then the writings of the Fathers. What? doe wee not vouch the Fathers on both ≈øides? are we not as confident vpon them as you? whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this, I be≈øeech you, if they bee ≈øo cleere that no doubt can bee made of them? And why doe you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe in your <hi>Flemi≈øh Expurgatorie Index,</hi> that <hi>in ancient Catholike Writers, yee tolerate many errors, yee extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and excu≈øe them, and often deny them by deui≈øing ≈øome ≈øhift, and faining a ≈øence vnto them when they are oppo≈øed again≈øt you?</hi> What need I ≈øay, all the≈øe tricks and fetches if there bee no ob≈øcurity in them? If literall and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall con≈øtruction may cary it, the Fathers are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly ours: and wee ≈øuppo≈øe they ment as they wrote, neither can you make any ≈øhew of an≈øwer, vnle≈ø≈øe you fall to expound the meaning of them.

<hi>Innocent,</hi> and <hi>Augu≈øtin,</hi> and other of the ancient Fathers ≈øay the contrary of them≈øelues, yet mu≈øt wee not belieue them.

                  <p>Happily you will ≈øay, the Scripture is indeed the rule of Faith, and the law of the Church, but not the Iudge; or if Iudge, yet but a mute and dumbe Iudge: and if there bee not ≈øome externall, vi≈øible, audible, infallible, vnerring Iudge to interpret Scriptures, and to ≈øtint all controuer≈øies, there will neuer bee an end of quarels, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will there euer bee peace and vnity in the Church.

Be≈øides this, mee thinks the facilne≈ø≈øe and ea≈øine≈ø≈øe of the way which your new Ma≈øters pre≈øcribe vnto you, ≈øhould make you much to ≈øu≈øpect the goodne≈ø≈øe of it. For whereas it is the good plea≈øure of God that all men ≈øhould carefully &amp; diligently ≈øtudie the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">P≈øal. 1.2. &amp; 119.</note> reading them, and meditating in them night and day, to the end they may grow rich in all knowledge and vnder≈øtanding: you by your rule may ≈øpare all this paines, and though you ≈øit ≈øtill, take your ea≈øe, and fold your hands, yet if you belieue what≈øoeuer your exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall human iudge ≈øhall dictate vnto you, you are ≈øafe and cannot mi≈øcarry. Now among ≈øimple and vnlettered Papi≈øts who is this Iudge, but ≈øome Prie≈øt or Ie≈øuite? for other Iudge I am ≈øure they meet with none. A plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible cour≈øe I confe≈ø≈øe to many, ≈øpecially tho≈øe that are idle and loth to take paines, or weake and dare not tru≈øt their owne iudgement, or ≈øuper≈øtitious and thinke they merit much by their blind obedience vnto their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But how plau≈øible ≈øoeuer it may ≈øeeme to fle≈øh and blood, ≈øure I am it is too broad to bee the narrow way that leadeth vnto life: and the Kingdome of Heauen will neuer be attained, vnle≈ø≈øe it ≈øuffer more violence then ≈øo.

                  <p>But to an≈øwer this yet a little more fully, I affirme three things. Fir≈øt, that holy Scripture knowes not, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ancient Fathers acknowledge not, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as long as wee haue the Scripture there needs not any ≈øuch ≈øtanding humane Iudge in the Church, as you dreame of. As touching the fir≈øt, if you know any pa≈ø≈øage of Scripture wherein God hath authorized ≈øuch a Iudge as you dreame of, I require you to ≈øhew it, for my part I know none. Expre≈ø≈øe Scripture I am ≈øure you cannot ≈øhew: deductions and con≈øequences by your owne rule I haue no rea≈øon to admit. For example, if for proofe hereof you vrge that of our Sauiour to S.
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue prayed for thee that thy Faith faile not:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 22.32.</note> I would <pb n="262" facs="tcp:10362:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> demand who ≈øhall bee iudge of the meaning of the≈øe words? for I heare that Chri≈øt hath prayed for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but I heare not that hee hath prayed for the Pope, that his Faith fayle not: and I know Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was firme and con≈øtant in the faith vnto his liues end, but it ≈øeemes by Eccle≈øia≈øticall Hy≈øtory that ≈øundry Popes haue made ≈øhipwracke of the Faith, and become Hereticks. If there be no Iudge to determine this doubt, why doe you thru≈øt ≈øuch a Iudge vpon vs? If there bee, who is hee? you will ≈øay, the Pope. Then thus you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, Chri≈øt prayed for S. <hi>Peter</hi> that his <hi>Faith might not faile,</hi> by S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Pope al≈øo is vnder≈øtood, and this appeares becau≈øe the Pope ≈øaith ≈øo: therefore neither can the Popes Faith faile and con≈øequently he is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary infallible Iudge of the Church More briefly thus, the Pope is that Iudge, becau≈øe the Pope will haue it ≈øo. Nominate what other Iudge ≈øoeuer you li≈øt, and what other Text be≈øides you plea≈øe, and the argument is ≈øtill the ≈øame, too weake to per≈øuade what you intend, vnle≈ø≈øe by ≈øome new priuiledge out of any premi≈ø≈øes you may conclude what you will. In a word, ≈øearch the Scriptures throughout, and you ≈øhall finde the Mini≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ≈øeruice of men e≈øtabli≈øhed to bring vs to the Faith: but an infallible humane magi≈øtery and Lord≈øhip to command Faith, it knowes none. That prerogatiue Royall it re≈øerues onely vnto Chri≈øt him≈øelfe.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe the ancient Fathers acknowledge any ≈øuch Iudge, which is the ≈øecond point. If they doe, point I pray to the place, for hitherto it hath beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Many and ≈øharp bickerings had tho≈øe ancients with diuers and ≈øundry Heretiks, as <hi>Arius, Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Eutyches, Nestorius,</hi> and the like: yet neuer did they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10362:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> either obiect vnto them that they wanted an infallible Iudge, as you doe vnto vs, or conuent them before the tribunall of ≈øuch a Iudge, which doubtle≈ø≈øe had beene a readier way then di≈øputation to ≈øtop their mouths, had there been ≈øuch a ≈øoueraigne Officer in the Church. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and manifold are the writings of the ancient Fathers touching the Chri≈øtian Faith, of which ≈øome al≈øo were purpo≈øely written to in≈øtruct vs in all the doctrines of our religion: and is it not ≈øtrange that ≈øuch men, in ≈øuch books, remembring carefully all other points, ≈øhould forget ≈øo maine and principall a point as this is? Nay more then this, <hi>Tertullian</hi> long agoe wrote a booke of Pre≈øcriptions or Fore-pleadings again≈øt Hereticks: Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> al≈øo wrote foure books of Chri≈øtian Doctrine, wherein his direct intent is to pre≈øcribe rules how to vnder≈øtand and interpret Scripture: And <hi>Vincentius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinen≈øis</hi> al≈øo hath written a ≈øhort Commonitory for the Antiquity and Verity of the Catholike Faith again≈øt the profane nouelties of all Here≈øies. If the≈øe Fathers had acknowledged this your imaginary Iudge, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to pa≈ø≈øe that they no where mention him in the≈øe books? For certainly here was the proper place, and they could not without extreame ≈øupinity and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence omit him, had they knowne ≈øuch a one: ≈øuch a one I ≈øay, as vpon whom the ≈øecurity of Faith, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church dependeth. But this deep ≈øilence of theirs, and that in ≈øo due a place, and of matter ≈øo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, euidently argues that they neuer were acquainted therewith, and that it is but an Idole of the≈øe latter times.</p>
                  <p>Now if neither Scripture nor Fathers know ≈øuch a Iudge, I hope I may bee bold to inferre that the Church <pb n="264" facs="tcp:10362:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> needs him not, which is the third point. For I trow this is both a ≈øafer and ≈øounder kind of rea≈øoning then that of yours, <hi>Such a Iudge wee conceiue to bee nece≈ø≈øary, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øuch a one hath God ordained.</hi> But to cleere this point al≈øo, I affirme that the Scriptures by them≈øelues, through Gods ble≈ø≈øing vpon our endeauour, is a ≈øufficient out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes to bring vs to ≈øaluation: and therefore there is no nece≈ø≈øity of your externall Iudge. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence is plaine and euident: the Antecedent thus I proue, becau≈øe all what≈øoeuer is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øaluation is ≈øo cleerely and manife≈øtly deliuered in them, euen to the capacity of vulgar and ordinary men, that if they will either read or heare it read vnto them, they cannot but know and vnder≈øtand it.

Be≈øides this, the Analogy of Faith teacheth vs, that Chri≈øts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <pb n="268" facs="tcp:10362:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> is a true Body like vnto ours: but that Body which you fancy to be in the Euchari≈øt is not like vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For in this Body there is no di≈øtance of one part from another, as of eye from eye, and head from feet, neither hath it any dimen≈øiue quantity, and is all both in Heauen and here on earth in the Sacrament at once, yet not in the middle region betweene, nor ≈øeparated from him≈øelfe: but nothing of this can bee affirmed of our bodies, or of any other organicall body. And if you ≈øay that you conceiue of Chri≈øts Body in the Sacrament as of a glorified Body, the plaine Scripture is again≈øt you, that when Chri≈øt ≈øpake the≈øe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> his Body was yet vncrucified and vnglorified.

Then I con≈øider further that our Sauiour now in≈øtitutes a Sacrament, and that in Sacramentall actions Sacramentall phra≈øes are v≈øuall, and the outward ≈øigne is called by the name of the thing ≈øignified: as in the old Te≈øtament,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.10.</note> Circumci≈øion is called the Couenant, and <pb n="269" facs="tcp:10362:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lambe the Pa≈ø≈øeouer, and in the new,<note place="margin">Ex. 12.11.</note> the Cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the new Te≈øtament or couenant.

You will ≈øay, this is to build vpon Con≈øequences, wherein it is po≈ø≈øible to bee deceiued. Whereunto I an≈øwer three things, fir≈øt, that what≈øoeuer may bee deduced out of the Word of God by euident Con≈øequence is certaine, euen by the certainty of Faith;<note place="margin">Bell. de Iu≈øt. l.
3. c. 8.</note> and this your owne greate≈øt clarks doe grant. Secondly, to bani≈øh Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from Diuinity, is to bani≈øh the v≈øe of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and di≈øcour≈øe al≈øo: and that religion mu≈øt needs bee driuen to narrow ≈øhifts, which cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt vnle≈ø≈øe men turne fooles or bea≈øts. Thirdly, the nece≈ø≈øity of a Con≈øequence doth not any way depend vpon the per≈øon of him that inferreth it, but onely vpon the mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ≈øtrait coniunction betweene the premi≈ø≈øes and it: ≈øo that by him who de≈øires to bee ≈øatisfied in the truth, not the per≈øon of him that deduceth it, but the Con≈øequence it ≈øelfe is to bee looked too, whether it bee rightly deduced or no. But who ≈øhall iudge that will you ≈øay? Indeed if you ≈øtand re≈øolued vtterly to renounce all the helps and directions both of rea≈øon and art, nor will yeeld to any Con≈øequence of Scripture how cleere and euident ≈øoeuer, but will only rely on the mouth and ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of your humane externall Iudge: I confe≈ø≈øe I am at

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10362:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> ≈øhewed, nor Scripture nor Fathers acknowledge ≈øuch a Iudge, if all what≈øoeuer is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øaluation bee ≈øo plainely laid downe in Scripture as a man of meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity may vnder≈øtand it, if what is more ob≈øcurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in one place is more plainely expre≈ø≈øed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if God haue appointed that out of the plainer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wee ≈øhould with ≈øtudy and indu≈øtrie picke the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of tho≈øe that are harder, if hee haue promi≈øed that tho≈øe that aske ≈øhall haue, tho≈øe that ≈øeeke ≈øhall find, and to tho≈øe that knocke it ≈øhall bee opened, if finally though wee mi≈ø≈øe the true meaning of tho≈øe harder places, yet firmely adhering vnto the plainer, wee are ≈øafe and out of danger: then certainely the readie≈øt and ≈øure≈øt way to to interpret Scripture is by Scripture, and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to determine controuer≈øies and to ≈øatisfy the con≈øcience but onely this. If any notwith≈øtanding this li≈øt ≈øtill to bee contentious,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee,</hi> ≈øaith S. <hi>Paul haue no ≈øuch cu≈øtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> The rule it ≈øelfe is infallible and al-≈øufficient: if wee either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot, or through negligence doe not v≈øe it as we ought, the fault is not in God, but in our ≈øelues, neither doth hee faile in his prouidence, but wee in our dutie.

<hi>We may ≈øit,</hi> or ≈øitting is a lawfull ge≈øture. In which ≈øence now vnder≈øtand you this Propo≈øition? In the fir≈øt?

For if ≈øitting bee the onely comely ge≈øture, then is not onely the Church of <hi>England</hi> to bee condemned for kneeling, but ≈øundry other reformed Churches al≈øo for ≈øtanding, yea our Sauiour him≈øelfe with all his Apo≈øtles, who (as in due place ≈øhall bee demon≈øtrated) <hi>≈øate not:</hi> to ≈øay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that it is your ≈øingular opinion, and that the man cannot bee named who held the ≈øame before you, or holds it be≈øides you.</p>
                  <p>For as for your rea≈øon, that <hi>≈øitting agrees with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ioy, which then must bee ≈øtirred vp,</hi> it is a very ≈øtrange and vnrea≈øonable one. For fir≈øt, bee it that ioy mu≈øt then bee ≈øtirred vp: ≈øo mu≈øt humility, reuerence, thankfulne≈ø≈øe al≈øo. And therefore if ≈øitting beecomely becau≈øe it agreeth with the one: Kneeling al≈øo is comely, becau≈øe it agreeth with the other. Againe, ≈øuppo≈øe that ≈øitting agree with Ioy: ≈øo doth leaping, dancing, exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10362:148" rendition="simple:additions"/> al≈øo. Why then if Sitting by vertue of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be comely, are not the re≈øt in like manner comely? La≈øtly, that
<hi>Sitting</hi> is the <hi>embleme of Re≈øt</hi> and that ≈øuch po≈øture of the body is fit for ≈øtudy, coun≈øell, meditation, I haue often heard: and ≈øo much is meant by tho≈øe old ≈øayings, <hi>The Romans conquer by ≈øitting,</hi> and <hi>By ≈øitting men become wi≈øe.</hi> But how it
<hi>agreeth with the affection of ioy,</hi> neither doe you ≈øhew it, neither can you: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leaue it as a fancy, vnkith vnki≈øt, as they ≈øay, and pa≈ø≈øe to your ≈øecond argument, which you conceiue in this forme.</p>

They are both from God, and both are to be our directors: the one in tho≈øe things that fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of nature, the other in tho≈øe things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature. In things ≈øupernaturall Scripture is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant, Rea≈øon being therein ≈øtarkblind: In things Morall it is the ≈øafe≈øt warrant, Rea≈øon therein being but dim≈øighted.

                  <p>The A≈ø≈øumption is, <hi>Kneeling is not conuenient.</hi> I deny it. You proue it by two places of Scripture, which te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that

                  <p>For fir≈øt, were it compiled by them, is it likely that Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> writing the hi≈øtory of their Acts, would haue omitted ≈øo principall a matter? Sundry other things of farre le≈ø≈øe con≈øequence hee hath carefully recorded: but of this ≈øo important and weighty a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe hee makes not ≈øo much as one word mention, which certainly hee would neuer haue failed to doe, had they done ≈øo. Adde hereunto that not one of the ancient Fathers who liued within the three fir≈øt <hi>Centuries of Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øpeake of any ≈øuch thing in any of their writings: and yet they ≈øhould be≈øt know it who≈øe times were neere≈øt vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles. This deep ≈øilence both of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and all tho≈øe ancient Doctors, make it vnto mee more then probable that the Apo≈øtles neuer compo≈øed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the ≈øilence of the≈øe worthies, ≈øo the very language of the Creed conuinceth it to bee yonger then the Apo≈øtles. For the word Catholike v≈øed in the Creed was not knowne in their time. Can any man thinke that the Church ≈øhould then bee called Catholike when it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10362:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> was not Catholike? For when they ≈øay this Creed was compiled, the Church was ≈øcarce begunne among the Iewes, and the Apo≈øtles had no where as yet preached the Go≈øpell among the Gentils.

Bee it ≈øo. Yet by your leaue when after the Apo≈øtles here≈øies were ri≈øen vp, and by diuer≈øity of names they laboured to rent and teare in peeces the done and queene of God: was it not requi≈øite that tho≈øe which were Apo≈øtolike ≈øhould haue a ≈øirname of their owne, whereby the vnity of tho≈øe that are vncorrupt might bee di≈øtingui≈øhed, and the error of none might rent in peeces the immaculate virgin of God? Thus hee. Again≈øt which if it bee obiected, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øtles of Iames, Peter, Iohn, and Iude</hi> are called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: I an≈øwer, the In≈øcriptions and Sub≈øcriptions of the Epi≈øtles are not Apo≈øtolicall, but added to them by ≈øome other, and ≈øometime vntruly. Neither is there any rea≈øon they ≈øhould bee ≈øo ≈øtiled aboue the re≈øt. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the doctrine contained in them more Catholicke then of all the other Epi≈øtles, neither were they written to all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> more then the Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> neither were they all written to all Catholicks, for the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third of
<hi>Iohn</hi> were ≈øent vnto priuate per≈øons onely, and all the re≈øt as vniuer≈øally concerne all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks <pb n="300" facs="tcp:10362:160"/> as the≈øe few tearmed Catholicke doe. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, the word Catholicke being latter then the Apo≈øtles, ≈øo mu≈øt the Creed bee al≈øo which v≈øes it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the different relation of the ≈øtory bewrayes the vncertainty of it: for they giue not all the ≈øame arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle vnto the ≈øame Apo≈øtle. Some mar≈øhall them iu≈øt as S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth in the fir≈øt of the Acts: others thus, <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iohn, Iames</hi> the elder,
<hi>Thomas, Iames</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Bartlemew, Mathew, Simon, Iude, Mathias.</hi> Againe, ≈øome of them attribute vnto <hi>Peter</hi> part onely of the fir≈øt article, <hi>I belieue in God the Father almighty,</hi> and vnto
<hi>Iohn</hi> the other part <hi>Maker of Heauen and Earth.</hi> But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers attribute the whole article vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> and giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vnto
<hi>Iohn.</hi> The like may bee ob≈øerued in other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. If then they bee certaine of the tradition, why doe they differ thus in their reports? If they differ thus one from another, who can bee certaine of the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the Creed both for matter &amp; forme were from the Apo≈øtles, and they deliuered it preci≈øely in tho≈øe words in which we now haue it, why is it not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Canon of Scripture? Certainly in the Church although it euer haue been much e≈øteemed, yet was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer counted Canonicall. Neither hath it been pre≈øerued ≈øo ≈øafe from addition, detraction, mutation, as the re≈øt of the Scriptures always haue been. For euen in the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt times we find great variety in it. <hi>Ruffin</hi> writing a iu≈øt comment on it, omits that clau≈øe <hi>Maker of Heauen and Earth.</hi> And who knowes not how many there are who relating this Creed leaue out the article of Chri≈øt de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell?<note place="margin">De Chri≈øti anima. c. 6</note> Euen <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him≈øelfe, confe≈ø≈øeth
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10362:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it was not found anciently in all Creeds: and hee voucheth for it <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian, and Augustin</hi> though fiue times he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d it, and finally the Creed of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> al≈øo as <hi>Ruffin</hi> witne≈ø≈øeth vnto whom if hee had been ≈øo plea≈øed, he might haue added a whole armie of others, whom for breuities ≈øake I omit. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ancient Doctors were ≈øo farre from equalling it with Scripture, that they appealed from it thereunto as to an higher authority.<note place="margin">Catech. 4.</note>

Which had they thought it had been from the Apo≈øtles in ≈øuch forme and as now we haue it, without que≈øtion they neuer would haue done.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the rea≈øon which they a≈ø≈øigne why they compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed this Creed, di≈øcouers the vanity thereof. What was that? That it might be for≈øooth vnto the Apo≈øtles a canon &amp; rule, according to which they ≈øhould ≈øquare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their preaching. What vnto the Apo≈øtles to whom Chri≈øt promi≈øed his ble≈ø≈øed Spirit that ≈øhould lead them into all truth? And that him≈øelfe would put into their mouths a ready an≈øwer vpon all occa≈øions, ≈øo that they ≈øhould not need to bethinke them≈øelues what to ≈øay? Could they po≈ø≈øibly doubt le≈øt any difference or di≈øcord ≈øhould grow among them in matter of Faith, who were ≈øo guided by the Spirit of truth and vnity that they could not in any point either erre them≈øelues, or lead any other into error? Surely, ≈øo to thinke, derogateth much from the truth of Chri≈øt, and imputeth much weakne≈ø≈øe vnto the Spirit of God, and detracteth from the certainty of <pb n="302" facs="tcp:10362:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> our Faith which dependeth on their preaching. So that for this cau≈øe it is vnlikely they made this Creed, at lea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe to this end.</p>

                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:10362:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>But yet among all the ancient Creeds, this of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles, hath euer beene counted of greate≈øt authority, and ought ≈øtill ≈øo to bee counted. Among the ancient Creeds I ≈øay: for the Scripture is peerles, and equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with it neither may it chalenge vnto it ≈øelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any of the ancient Fathers giue it, as aboue wee haue touched. For although the ≈øub≈øtance and matter of the Creed be diuine and perfectly according with the Scripture, yet for forme and order of words it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: whereas the Scripture both for ≈øub≈øtance and circum≈øtance, matter and forme and all is no way hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but wholly and entirely diuine. The greater the bla≈øphemie of <hi>Rhemi≈øh Ie≈øuites</hi> auouching this Creed to be the Rule whereby all the writings of the new Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be tried,<note place="margin">In Ro. 12.6.</note> and approued: whereas contrarily the Scripture out of which the Creed is collected, is the only Rule by which both it and all other Creeds are to bee examined. Howbeit the ≈øecond place, as it is its due, ≈øo we willingly yeeld vnto it. Fir≈øt in regard of the antiquity thereof, becau≈øe of all other it is the elde≈øt. Secondly, for the perfection and fulnes thereof, there being no one article of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity vnto <hi>Saluation,</hi> which is not either in expre≈ø≈øe tearmes or impliedly and in its principles contayned therein. Thirdly and la≈øtly, becau≈øe it hath had the vniuer≈øall approbation of all Churches, in all times, both ancient and moderne. The ancient Fathers giue vnto it mo≈øt honorable and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent titles. They call it, <hi>the key of Faith, the rule of Faith, the foundation of Faith, the ≈øumme of Faith, the forme of Faith, the body of Faith, the rule of truth, the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of humane ≈øaluation, the my≈øterie of religion, the character of the Church,</hi> and the like.

Finally, it was their manner neuer to admit any that was <hi>adultus</hi> either to the Sacrament of <hi>Bapti≈øme,</hi> or to the holy
<hi>Eucharist</hi> without making confe≈ø≈øion of his Faith by rehear≈øing this Creed. In like manner, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Churches</hi> with all reuerence and duty receiue it: they v≈øe it in their publick
<hi>Liturgies,</hi> and expound it in their <hi>Catechi≈ømes.</hi> The more malitious is the ≈ølander of <hi>Gregorie Martin</hi> and others,<note place="margin">Di≈øc. of Eng. tran≈ø. c. 12.</note> who ≈øhame not to ≈øay that <hi>we hold not the Chri≈øtian Faith of the articles of the Creed.</hi> Yea, ≈øaith another of vs, <hi>they haue no faith nor religion,</hi>

                     <p>To this argument thus formed I an≈øwer, fir≈øt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Maior Propo≈øition: which in that you goe not about to proue, you commit that fault in rea≈øoning which Logicians call <hi>Petitionem Principij,</hi> taking that for granted which is mo≈øt que≈øtioned.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:10362:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> all of them, as you Separati≈øts doe, inferre thereupon a nullity, but onely a corruption or aberration in the Church.

                        </argument>
                        <p>What meane you by the word <hi>Antichri≈øtian?</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know well what properly it ≈øignifies, yet I doubt much what you vnder≈øtand thereby: it being your manner either through negligence or ignorance too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ≈øpeake improperly. If you vnder≈øtand it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as you ought, for that which is again≈øt Chri≈øt and his ordinance, or, as your men ≈øometimes expre≈ø≈øe them≈øelues, which is a ≈øpeciall part of Antichri≈øts apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øta≈øie, then I yeeld you your Maior, and confe≈ø≈øe that no ≈øuch Mini≈øtrie may bee ≈øet ouer the Church nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein. But if you meane thereby either that which was fir≈øt in≈øtituted and deuized by Antichri≈øt, or that which being formerly in≈øtituted is v≈øed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church of Antichri≈øt, then I deny the Maior. For fir≈øt, euery thing (by Antichri≈øt ordained) is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently vnlawfull and Antichri≈øtian, no more then euery act of a tyrant is vniu≈øt and tyrannous. How many good and whole≈øome lawes were enacted vnder the raigne of
<hi>Richard</hi> the third, who yet was a mo≈øt bloody and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrant? Neither were they afterward repealed by ≈øucceeding Kings, but ≈øtand ≈øtill in force notwith≈øtanding <pb n="330" facs="tcp:10362:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> his tyranny: for they proceeded from him <hi>non qu√† ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus,</hi> not as hee was a tyrant, but as hee was a wi≈øe and politicke gouernour. In like manner, not euery thing ordained by Antichri≈øt is foorthwith to bee reiected, but onely that which hee doth <hi>qu√† Antichristus,</hi> as hee is Antichri≈øt, and is meerely Antichri≈øtian. It is a great folly to refu≈øe good coun≈øell becau≈øe it is giuen by an euill man. Wi≈øe men will con≈øider <hi>non quis ≈øed quid,</hi> not ≈øo much who doth a thing, as what is done. For as truth is Gods in who≈øe mouth ≈øoeuer it bee found: ≈øo is good al≈øo who≈øoeuer bee the Author thereof. Againe, if tho≈øe things whereof Antichri≈øt is the fir≈øt founder bee not therefore by and by vnlawfull, much le≈ø≈øe are tho≈øe things ≈øo, which being of a former in≈øtitution are onely v≈øed and ob≈øerued by him. Were it otherwi≈øe, how many ordinances of God him≈øelfe, and whole≈øome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutions of the primitiue Church would proue vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being ≈øtill retained in Popery?</p>
                        <p>This Maior you endeauour to fortify with ≈øundry pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages of Scripture. But as <hi>Ca≈øsius</hi> of old was wont to ≈øay,
<hi>Cui bono?</hi> to what end? For if you would proue it in the ≈øen≈øe granted you, they are alledged needle≈øly: if in the ≈øen≈øe denied, friuolou≈øly; and to ≈øpeake the truth euery way vainely and impertinently, as the very reading of them will manife≈øt to any one that will but take the paines to peru≈øe them. But this is the manner of your men to paint your margents with multitude of quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nothing to the purpo≈øe: whereas one allegation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concluding is more then a hundred demon≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being the words of the fir≈øt and infallible verity. What you intend hereby I wot not, whether to amu≈øe the Reader and ouerwhelme him with your numbers, or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:10362:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> to win you credit and e≈øtimation with the vulgar, as if you were the onely skilfull Text-men. But ≈øure I am that ≈øuch ≈øleighting of Scripture is no le≈ø≈øe then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods Name in vaine: which who≈øoeuer doth, the Lord profe≈ø≈øeth he <hi>will not hold him guiltle≈øse.</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not made nor appointed for pompe and ≈øhew, but for conque≈øt and victory.</p>
                        <p>To the Minor Propo≈øition I an≈øwer negatiuely, <hi>The mini≈øtrie of Arch-bi≈øhops, Lord-Bi≈øhops, and Prie≈øts</hi> is not Antichri≈øtian, whether you vnder≈øtand it as fir≈øt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antichri≈øt, or again≈øt Chri≈øt. That it is not of Antichri≈øts inuention is as cleere as the Sunne. For fir≈øt Prie≈øts are of diuine in≈øtitution, being no other then tho≈øe Presbyters or Pa≈øtors, to whom the admini≈øtration of the Word and Sacraments is committed, and who are ordained by Chri≈øt for the building vp of his Church vnto the end of the world. The Prie≈øts of the Church of Rome indeed are of Antichri≈øts founding, who≈øe office is to ≈øacrifice and offer vp Chri≈øt him≈øelfe in the Ma≈ø≈øe vnto his Father both for the quicke and the dead. But our Prie≈øts haue nothing common with them ≈øaue the name onely: their idolatry wee dete≈øt and abhorre, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee retaine the name. Theirs are Ma≈ø≈øe-Prie≈øts, ours are Preaching or Mini≈øtring Prie≈øts. Neither let the name offend you: for notwith≈øtanding Papi≈øts haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øed it to ≈øignifie a Sacrificer, yet properly it doth not ≈øo, being originally deriued from Presbyter, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs is it now ≈øo vnder≈øtood. To ≈øay nothing that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t Fathers (who I pre≈øume were not Antichri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) v≈øually call the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> Prie≈øts. As therefore you cannot without great ab≈øurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rea≈øon from the name to the thing, thus,
<hi>your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <pb n="332" facs="tcp:10362:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> are called Prie≈øts, Ergo, your Mini≈øtrie is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian:</hi> ≈øo neither can you without greater ab≈øurdity ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your ≈øelfe from the thing becau≈øe of the name, and becau≈øe our Mini≈øters are called Prie≈øts withdraw your ≈øelfe from our Mini≈øtrie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Arch-bi≈øhops and Bi≈øhops if they be not of diuine in≈øtitution, yet were they ≈øome Centuries of yeeres before euer Antichri≈øt appeared in the world, as all antiquity and Eccle≈øia≈øticall Story te≈øtifieth. That mo≈øt famous fir≈øt generall Councell of Nice a≈ø≈øembled by <hi>Con≈øtantin the Great</hi> about the yeere of our Lord
327 not onely approueth them, but al≈øo affirmeth that the Church anciently and long before that time had been gouerned by them. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> &amp;
<hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> both reckon <hi>Aerius</hi> among the number of Hereticks, for denying the then-receiued and allowed di≈øtinction between a Bi≈øhop and a Presbyter. But to ≈øpeake my mind plainely, I am for my part per≈øwaded, that the ≈øuperiority of Bi≈øhops ouer the Mini≈øters was of Apo≈øtolicall in≈øtitution. Tho≈øe Angels to whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the ≈øecond and third of the Reuelation is commanded to write, what other were they then the Bi≈øhops of tho≈øe Churches of <hi>A≈øia?</hi> In <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øus,</hi> one of tho≈øe ≈øeuen Churches, it is reported by S. <hi>Luke</hi> that there were many Presbyters, and I doubt not but it was ≈øo in other of the Churches al≈øo: howbeit the Apo≈øtle writeth vnto one onely whom hee calleth the Angell, as being ≈øingular and eminent aboue the re≈øt. And the ancient ≈øtory of the Church recordeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bi≈øhops of euery one of tho≈øe Churches together with their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors for a long time. So that Bi≈øhops being in the Apo≈øtles time, and ≈øucce≈ø≈øiuely continued in the Primitiue Church, without any contradiction either <pb n="333" facs="tcp:10362:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Apo≈øtles them≈øelues or any other, yea rather with their approbation and allowance, as appeareth by tho≈øe ≈øeuen Epi≈øtles vnto the ≈øeuen Angels, and all the writings of the ancient Fathers: how can it bee imagined but that Bi≈øhops and their ≈øuperiority ouer others was of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolicall in≈øtitution?</p>
                        <p>Now if <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> (for as wee haue ≈øayd, in ≈øub≈øtance they be all one) were ordained by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and <hi>Bi≈øhops</hi> deriue their pedigree al≈øo from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Apostles</hi> of God: it followeth by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that as our <hi>Mini≈øtery</hi> is not from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> ≈øo neither is it again≈øt Chri≈øt. Were it again≈øt Chri≈øt, it would be either becau≈øe he hath forbidden it, or for that it de≈øtroyeth rather then edifieth the
<hi>Church.</hi> But it is no where forbidden. If it bee, ≈øhew the place, and wee yeeld. Neither doth it hinder the edification of the <hi>Church.</hi> For fir≈øt it is the office both of <hi>Bi≈øhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> to preach the Go≈øpell of Chri≈øt, and to admini≈øter his holy
<hi>Sacraments.</hi> Secondly, the aduancement of one <hi>Pre≈øbyter</hi> aboue the re≈øt, was for the preuention of <hi>Schi≈øme.</hi> For when
<hi>Factions began to ari≈øe in the Church, ≈øome ≈øaying I am of Paul, others I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas: then, ≈øayth Hierom, was it decreed through the whole world, that one being cho≈øen from among the Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ≈øhould be ≈øet ouer the re≈øt.</hi> Who being ≈øo prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his duty is to ouer≈øee the re≈øt of his brethren, that they carefully di≈øcharge the office impo≈øed vpon them, and frame their liues according to the worthines of their calling: All which I am ≈øure furthereth the building of the
<hi>Church,</hi> ≈øo farre is it from de≈øtroying: ≈øo that nor Prie≈øts nor <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> whether yee regard their offices, or the end of their ordination, can be ≈øayd to be again≈øt Chri≈øt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I di≈øtingui≈øh of the middle tearme Called: for there is
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10362:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> a double calling, the one is <hi>Gratiae oblatae,</hi> where by God onely inuites men vnto Chri≈øt, and offers them Grace, the other <hi>Gratiae inditae &amp; infu≈øae,</hi> whereby hee not only offers but infu≈øeth grace al≈øo into them. The former Calling maketh not a man of the Church: for hee that is no otherwi≈øe called, an≈øwereth not by Faith, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto Chri≈øt, but remaineth ≈øtill in infidelity, and ≈øo is vtterly excluded out of the Church. Of the latter Calling I di≈øtingui≈øh againe, for it is either that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee be≈øtoweth vpon man Faith of Doctrine, or that whereby ouer and aboue hee giues them Iu≈øtification together with true Sanctification. Faith of Doctrine is either a Partiall or an Entire Faith: a Partiall Faith whereby part onely of the Chri≈øtian verity is held, or an Entire Faith by which the whole ≈øauing truth is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and profe≈ø≈øed: And this againe either in Vnity or in Schi≈øme, in Vnity with other Churches of God, or in Schi≈øme with Separation from them. Now all the≈øe and eueryone of them are of the Chri≈øtian Church: for they are neither Gentiles, nor Iewes, nor Turks, being by the calling of grace brought to the profe≈ø≈øion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion. But yet among them there is exceeding great difference: for they that hold the entire truth of Chri≈øt are of that Chri≈øtian Church, which is called Oxthodoxall: they that hold it in part onely, are of that Chri≈øtian Church which is Hereticall. They that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely hold the truth in Vnity with other Churches of God, are of that Chri≈øtian Orthodoxall Church which is Catholicke: they that hold the ≈øame whole truth in Separation from them are of that Chri≈øtian Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall Church which is Schi≈ømaticall. And ≈øuch is the Church of Browni≈øts to which you haue adioyned your <pb n="349" facs="tcp:10362:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> ≈øelfe. But they who hold the whole truth of Chri≈øt not onely in Vnity but al≈øo in Sincerity, being truly iu≈øtified by Faith and Sanctified in the lauour of Regeneration, they I ≈øay are of that Chri≈øtian Orthodoxall Catholicke Church which is Inui≈øible and knowne only vnto God. For although both the per≈øons and profe≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe that are thus called, be vi≈øible, and may by outward ≈øen≈øe bee di≈øcerned, whereby in the eye of Charity they are to bee counted Gods elect people: yet the inward truth and ≈øincerity of the heart is to vs inui≈øible, and ≈øeene of none but onely him who trieth the heart and raines, and ≈øo alone knoweth who are his.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe di≈øtinctions thus promi≈øed I come at length to an≈øwer your Syllogi≈øme, and demand of you which of the≈øe Callings it is that you meane. If the la≈øt, whereby wee haue receiued entirely to belieue the whole truth of Chri≈øt, and that not onely in Vnity, but al≈øo in Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and with a ≈øanctified heart: then I deny the Maior, for it is not the Vi≈øible but the Inui≈øible Church alone that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øi≈øts of ≈øuch members. Neither can ≈øuch a Vi≈øible Church bee found vpon the face of the earth: for here corne and cockle, chaffe and wheat, Saints and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrits are mingled together, neither can you affirme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Church whereunto now you a≈ø≈øociate your ≈øelfe. If you meane any other of the Callings aboue mentioned, or all of them be≈øides this la≈øt, then I deny your Minor. For here in England wee are a company of people to whom not onely grace hath beene offered, but who al≈øo haue receiued grace to belieue the truth of Chri≈øt, and therefore are not Infidels but of the Church of Chri≈øt. Againe we haue receiued to belieue the whole truth, and therefore are an Oxthodoxall not an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb n="350" facs="tcp:10362:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church.

                  <head>OF VOWES AND SPECIALLY THAT OF VIRGINITY.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OVR de≈øire to bee re≈øolued touching the vow of Virginity or Single life, both how law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is, &amp; how farre it bindes. I will endeauour to ≈øatisfie you as breefly and plainly as I can: fir≈øt ≈øhewing you what is the nature and definition of a vow in generall, and then applying it vnto your particular que≈øtion for the more ea≈øie and fuller determination thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A vow rightly defined is <hi>a promi≈øe made vnto God of things lawfull, by ≈øuch as haue power ≈øo to doe, thereby to te≈øtify their affection and duty towards him.</hi> This ≈øhort definition containing the whole and entire nature of a lawfull Vow, I will for your better vnder≈øtanding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in the ≈øeuerall parts thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I call it a Promi≈øe not a Purpo≈øe: for a Purpo≈øe being only an inclination of the minde to do ≈øomething, <pb n="357" facs="tcp:10362:188"/> binds not vnto performance, and is alterable without ≈øin: But a Promi≈øe comprehendeth both a Purpo≈øe and Obligation al≈øo, binding the Con≈øcience vnto perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: ab≈øolutely, if the forme of the Promi≈øe be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute, conditionally if conditionall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this promi≈øe whether it be internally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the heart or externally vttered by the mouth, it is all one vnto God, who vnder≈øtandeth as well the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the one as of the other. Yet as in Praying ≈øo in Vowing ≈øpeech is not vnprofitable, the ≈øolemnity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both more inwardly affecting our ≈øelues, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more edifying others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Party to whom Vowes are to bee directed is God only: for it is a part of diuine wor≈øhip, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the third commandement. A part of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip I ≈øay ≈øimply if it bee of things commanded, if of things indifferent accidentally only, ina≈ømuch as it is referred to the wor≈øhip of God, and therefore cannot without ≈øacriledge be giuen to any creature.</p>

Pract. comp. tract. 2. c. 8. art. 33.</note> How then can the Popi≈øh Church vowing vnto Saints quit her≈øelfe of notorious Idolatrie? ≈øpecially ≈øeing by the confe≈ø≈øion of Molanus a principall champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hers, a Vow is an act of latria, that is of ≈øuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip as is due vnto God.

                  <p n="6">6. The matter of a vow is things lawfull, whether they be nece≈ø≈øary as being commanded, or arbitrary as being neither forbidden nor commanded. For that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded may be vowed appeareth euen by the

                     <note place="margin">De Monach. c. 19.</note>7.
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed is bold and affirmeth that it is <hi>the common opinion of Diuines, that the Promi≈øe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme is not properly a vow:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. That things of an indifferent and middle nature may al≈øo be Vowed is granted of all hands, God hauing permitted vnto the Church and members thereof iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and di≈øpen≈øation of them. Yet this mu≈øt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood with caution: for ≈øeeing as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith,
<hi>tho≈øe things that are lawfull are not alwayes expedient,</hi> and things otherwi≈øe lawfull may in regard of circum≈øtance become vnlawfull, tho≈øe indifferent things that are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted with ≈øuch circum≈øtances cea≈øe during the while to be the matter of a Vow.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Iu≈øtly therefore are excluded from being the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Uow, fir≈øt all ≈øuch actions as are in their owne nature euill, next ≈øuch as hinder a greater good, then tho≈øe that cro≈ø≈øe the generall Vow made in Bapti≈øme, farther ≈øuch as are impo≈ø≈øible and out of our power, moreouer ≈øuch as are friuolous and vnprofitable, finally tho≈øe things that are naturally nece≈ø≈øary, and if there be any other be≈øides of the like quality.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I adde farther by ≈øuch as haue power ≈øo to doe: for none may Vow but they who by their vocation haue liberty thereunto. Now this vocation in regard of things commanded extendeth vniuer≈øally vnto all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="359" facs="tcp:10362:189"/> it is free for euery man to vow them. But in re≈øpect of things indifferent it ≈øtretcheth not ≈øo farre: For fir≈øt they who by rea≈øon of age or di≈øtemper haue not the v≈øe of rea≈øon or iudgment, ≈øecondly they who are vnder the authority, and iuri≈ødiction of others, hauing not power of them≈øelues becau≈øe of their calling may not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully vow without the con≈øent and good liking of their ≈øuperiors.<note place="margin">Num. 30.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. This condemnes the impious practice of Popi≈øh Friers, who inueigle yong youths from the obedience of their parents, and without their con≈øents intangle them in the vow of Mona≈øticall life, treading directly in the ≈øteps of their Great-grand-father

                     <hi>If any children ≈øhall for≈øake their Parents e≈øpecially being faithfull vpon occa≈øion of Religion thinking it iu≈øt ≈øo to doe, and ≈øhall not rather performe due honor vnto them, reuerencing euen this in them that they are faithfull let them be accur≈øed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Finally the End of a Vow is partly to te≈øtify our affection to God, as namely our thankfulne≈ø≈øe for benefits receiued: and partly our duty in carefulne≈ø≈øe to preuent ≈øinne, and to pre≈øerue and increa≈øe Gods graces in vs. In a word it ≈øerues as an in≈øtrument or helping meanes to further our obedience to Gods Lawes. And becau≈øe the End it ≈øelfe is of greater importance then the meanes conducing vnto the End, ≈øurely Obedience mu≈øt needs bee better then Sacrifice, that is, then the Vow which fitteth only vnto it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The <hi>Romi≈øh Church</hi> therefore teaching that vowes are of greater perfection in this life, and de≈øerue an higher degree of glory in the next, then the very works <pb n="360" facs="tcp:10362:190"/> of the Morall law, cannot be excu≈øed of manife≈øt bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.<note place="margin">Comment. in Mat. 19.</note> Which it ≈øeemes <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> al≈øo ≈øaw when he ≈øaid, that <hi>Chri≈øt pre≈øcribeth no vow to him that will obtaine perfection of life: becau≈øe the obtaining of perfection con≈øisteth not in the bonds of vowes but in the works them≈øelues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. This being the true nature and definition of a vow, I conclude as touching the Obligation or bond thereof, that euery vow thus made vnto God, in ≈øuch Forme, of ≈øuch Matter, by ≈øuch Per≈øons, to ≈øuch End, as wee haue ≈øaid, bindeth the Con≈øcience vnto perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: in ≈øo much as the breach thereof is no le≈ø≈øe then mortall ≈øin, and very di≈øhonorable vnto God. For if lawfull promi≈øes are to bee held with men, much more with God.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 15.</note> And <hi>if we bee ≈ølack to pay them hee will ≈øurely require them of us, and ≈øo ≈øhould it be ≈øin vnto us.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Deut. 23.21.</note>15. But what if a man haue ra≈øhly vowed that which is vnlawfull? Surely in ≈øuch a ca≈øe it is better to retract the vow, then by keeping it to adde ≈øin vnto ≈øin. For a vow, ≈øaith the Canon, may not be the bond of iniquity: and excellently to this purpo≈øe coun≈øelleth <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Now let vs apply what hath beene ≈øaid vnto the particular vow of virginity, or ≈øingle life. And fir≈øt whereas nothing may be the Matter of a vow but that which is lawfull, and things lawfull are of two ≈øorts, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øimply and morally good, or arbitrary and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:10362:190"/> ≈øurely Virginity cannot be ranked in the fir≈øt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

But Virginity is no where commanded, and is de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Matrimony which is no ≈øinne (although Pope <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricius</hi> heretically call it vncleanne≈ø≈øe and pollution of the fle≈øh) and being lo≈øt cannot po≈ø≈øibly be recouered. And therefore how≈øoeuer it may giue a kind of lu≈øter and grace vnto vertue, yet vertue it can be none.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Hereupon it followeth that Virginity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are not in them≈øelues acceptable vnto God one more then another, but that it is the mind which rightly v≈øeth both the one and the other which is plea≈øing vnto him: and that they are rather diuers ≈øorts of life, then differences or degrees of liuing better or wor≈øe.

                  <head>A LETTER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N≈øteed of a few words which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to write you, I haue here ≈øent this little treati≈øe, which if you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read and peru≈øe, it will more fully informe and re≈øolue you then I ≈øhould haue done. Neuerthele≈ø≈øe, that I may in ≈øome ≈øort di≈øcharge my promi≈øe, and not altogether faile your expectation, in few words thus. I would wi≈øh you diligently to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that to bee grieued and troubled for ≈øinne is a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary duty, and that it ought to be ≈øo. For as in the poole of
<hi>Bethe≈øda</hi> there could bee no cure wrought vntill the Angell had troubled the water: ≈øo neither is there any remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes and healing of the ≈øoule, vntill by the worke of Gods Spirit the heart bee bruzed and broken. When ≈øuch an Angell as <hi>Peter</hi> was, ≈øhall by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching haue pricked the Con≈øcience, and made men both to ≈øee their ≈øinne, and to feele the mi≈øery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: then and not before doe they crie out, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ≈øhall wee doe?</hi> Sorrow for ≈øinne is a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øorrow. A broken and contrite ≈øpirit God neuer yet de≈øpi≈øed. Tho≈øe, and tho≈øe alone who feele the heauy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:10362:193"/> loade and burden of their ≈øinnes doth Chri≈øt inuite vnto him, and vnto them doth hee promi≈øe refre≈øhment. Hee that oftentimes watered his couch with his teares, and as oftenta≈øted the ≈øweet con≈øolations of Gods ble≈ø≈øed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hath out of his experience ≈øeriou≈øly affirmed that who≈øoeuer ≈øoweth in teares ≈øhall ≈øurely reap in ioy, and a day of reioycing ≈øhall euer ≈øucceed the night of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And to ≈øpeake the truth, ≈øorrow was made for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for ≈øinne. A potion is made onely for that di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe which it is able to cure: and ≈øorrow for that onely which it is able to remedie. Lo≈ø≈øe of friends, health, wealth and the like were neuer yet recouered with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but the teares of true repentance haue euer clean≈øed the ≈øoule from ≈øinne, and purcha≈øed both pardon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from God. Sorrow therefore was made onely for ≈øinne. Mourne then in Gods name for your ≈øinnes: but yet take heed you mourne not as tho≈øe that are without hope. You cannot doe a greater wrong vnto the infinite mercy of God, and the inualuable merits of Chri≈øt your Sauiour, then to thinke them le≈ø≈øe then your ≈øinnes or demerits. If Satan ≈øugge≈øt any ≈øuch thing vnto you, ≈øpare him not, but tell him hee lies: for Gods goodnes cannot bee outreached by mans wickedne≈ø≈øe, and where ≈øinne doth abound, grace doth much more abound. If your ≈øinnes were as red as ≈øcarlet, yet vpon your true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance God both can and will make you as white as ≈ønow: And of your repentance you cannot well make doubt, there being in you, as you haue confe≈ø≈øed vnto mee, both hearty ≈øorrow for ≈øinnes pa≈øt, and vnfained re≈øolution of amendement for the time to come, which are the two e≈ø≈øentiall parts of true repentance. Yea but you haue committed that ≈øinne which is vnto death and <pb n="368" facs="tcp:10362:194" rendition="simple:additions"/> can neuer bee forgiuen nor in this nor in the next world. If ≈øo, to what end doe you ≈øeeke vnto mee for comfort? And why doe I wa≈øt paper in writing vnto you? But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground haue you entertayned this conceit? For≈øooth you haue often ≈øworne and for≈øworne again≈øt your knowledge. I will not extenuate your ≈øin: it is I confe≈ø≈øe grieuous and fearefull, neither would I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder you from a long pennance in ≈øackcloth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhes for the ≈øame. Howbeit I would adui≈øe you to ≈øteere right betweene the≈øe two dangerous gulfes: for as you mu≈øt not make mole-hils of mountaines, nor frailties of furies, ≈øo neither mu≈øt you of euery ≈øinne, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe heinous and enormious make that vnpardonable ≈øin again≈øt the Holy Gho≈øt. It is not often ≈øwearing or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing, no nor for≈øwearing or periury and the like, which God neither can nor will forgiue. For then what ≈øhould become of that worthy Apo≈øtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwore his Lord and Sauiour, euen again≈øt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and that not once but thrice, with mo≈øt horrible execration and cur≈øing? you haue not ≈øinned in ≈øo high a nature as <hi>Peter</hi> did, neuerthele≈ø≈øe now that Chri≈øt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backe vpon you as hee did on him, touching your heart with con≈øideration of what you haue done, I giue you good leaue to goe foorth with him and to weep as bitterly as you can. But de≈øpaire not of pardon, nor count it the ≈øinne again≈øt the Holy Gho≈øt, for ≈øo did not hee. That ≈øinne is no le≈ø≈øe then a wilfull, malicious, and ob≈øtinate denying of the foundation, namely that Ie≈øus is the Mediator and Redeemer of the world. It is a totall apo≈øta≈øie from the Faith, when the whole man reuolteth from the whole Chri≈øtian Religion wholly, with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinate re≈øolution neuer to returne to it any more. This <pb n="369" facs="tcp:10362:194"/> ≈øinne I know you are farre from, and you dare not ≈øay you haue committed it. Neither is it po≈ø≈øible for him that is guilty thereof to doe as you now a long time haue done, that is to mourne and lament for his ≈øinnes. His ≈øtubborne and reprobate heart is not ≈øo tender, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pa≈øt all ≈øorrow and feeling rather reioyceth in his de≈øperate and malicious ob≈øtinacy. More I might write, but let this little booke I ≈øend you bee in≈øteed thereof. It remayneth that henceforward you play the valiant ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chri≈øt, and ≈øuffer not your ≈øelfe any longer to be led by pa≈ø≈øion, but onely by the rules and directions of Gods ble≈ø≈øed Word. For my part I will not cea≈øe to pray vnto the Father of our Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt for you, that this pricke may be eft≈øoones taken from you: or if for you further exerci≈øe and triall hee delay you a little longer, that yet your Faith may ≈øettle and re≈øt vpon that an≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which God gaue vnto <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the like ca≈øe,
<hi>My grace is ≈øufficient for thee. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>

                  <p>As Scripture, ≈øo the Analogie of Faith al≈øo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it. For no rea≈øon can be rendred why <hi>Mary</hi> ≈øhould not be the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> but eyther becau≈øe Chri≈øt is not God, or becau≈øe the humanity was the ≈øubject of Conception and Birth before it was a≈ø≈øumpted by the Word, or la≈øtly becau≈øe the Humanity was neuer a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumpted into the Vnity of the ≈øame Per≈øon, but remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a di≈øtinct per≈øon by it ≈øelfe: all which were the damnable bla≈øphemies and here≈øies of <hi>Arius, Photinus, and Ne≈øtorius,</hi> the fir≈øt of <hi>Arius,</hi> the ≈øecond of
<hi>Photinus,</hi> the third of <hi>Nestorius.</hi> Therefore contrarywi≈øe I argue thus, If Chri≈øt bee God, and the Humanity were at the fir≈øt creation thereof preuented from ≈øub≈øi≈øting in it ≈øelfe, and neuer had ≈øub≈øi≈øtence but in the Word, ≈øo as both Natures con≈øtitute one onely
<hi>Hypo≈øta≈øis or Per≈øon:</hi> certenly there cannot bee two Sonnes, one of God, and another of Mary, but the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> mu≈øt needs be the Sonne of Mary, and ≈øo Mary be the <hi>Mother of the Sonne of God.</hi> And as by rea≈øon of this <hi>Hypo≈øtaticall vnion Chri≈øt</hi> him≈øelfe doubted not to ≈øay, <hi>The Sonne of Man came <pb n="376" facs="tcp:10362:198"/> downe from heauen:</hi> ≈øo the ≈øame analogie and proportion of Faith requires vs to ≈øay, <hi>The Sonne of God is borne of the Virgin Mary,</hi> which as
<hi>Vincentius Lirinen≈øis</hi> ≈øaith, is mo≈øt catholickly beleeued, and mo≈øt impiou≈øly denied.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be added hereunto: but to them that iudge of per≈øons by the Faith this is too much, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough euen to them that iudge of Faith by Per≈øons. Only from hence I inferre fir≈øt that <hi>Titius</hi> confounding Papi≈øts in open pulpit for calling the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin
<hi>Deiparam, the Mother of God,</hi> either knew not what he ≈øaid, and ≈øo proued him≈øelfe but a nouice in Diuinity: or if he ≈øpake adui≈øedly and out of iudgement, it was no le≈ø≈øe then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed here≈øy. Secondly that I di≈øapprouing <hi>Titius</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cannot iu≈øtly bee taxed of tricks or niceties or <hi>≈øpirit of contradiction,</hi> vnle≈ø≈øe together with mee, <hi>Councels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Prote≈øtants, the Apostolicall and Chalcedonian Creed, Scripture and the Analogie of Faith,</hi> vndergoe the ≈øame cen≈øure. La≈øtly, that as Seneca (otherwi≈øe an excellent Morali≈øt) ≈øpake very irregularly when hee ≈øaid <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes would ≈øooner be commended in Cato, then Cato con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for his Drunkennes:</hi> ≈øo you (though els I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade my ≈øelfe a ≈øound and <hi>Orthodoxe Christian</hi>) much ≈øwarued from the rule of Piety and Faith, when you cho≈øe rather to excu≈øe <hi>Nestoriani≈øme</hi> in <hi>Titius,</hi> then with me to condemne him for it. And all lea≈øt ≈øome who haue ouer prodigally be≈øtowed tran≈øcendent and immoderate pray≈øes vpon him, ≈øhould ≈øeeme eyther too weake in iudgement, or too ≈øtrong in pa≈ø≈øion.</p>
