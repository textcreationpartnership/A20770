            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For no ſooner was I there arrived, but preſently they repaired vnto me, and like ſo many <hi>Iacobs</hi> began to wreſtle with me,<note place="margin">Gen

                  <p>One time among the reſt I choſe for my Theme that of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:10362:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Satan, I held it neceſſary with all diligence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what might be the <hi>true nature</hi> and definition thereof, and at length I reſolued that the Act thereof was not Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but Affiance, the Subiect not the vnderſtanding, but the will; and the Obiect not preſent grace and future glory, but the perſon of the Mediator. So that I defined it, not as vulgarly it is conceiued, An aſsurance that we are already juſtified and ſhall be ſaued; but thus, An affiance vpon Chriſt the Mediator for juſtification and conſequently Saluation. The occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouing me to intreat of this argument was this; A certaine graue and godly Matrone of that City hauing beene a long time ſore afflicted with ſickneſse both in mind and body, I went vpon entreaty with other friends to viſit her; and after mutuall ſalutation, Siſter quoth I vnto her, were I Phyſitian for the body, I would aduiſe you the beſt I could for the health thereof: but it is not my element, and therefore I may not without great raſhneſse put my ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: neuertheleſse if you ſhall pleaſe to diſcouer vnto me the wound of your ſpirit, happily I may apply ſuch a ſalue thereunto, as by the bleſsing of God may cloſe it vp, or at leaſt giue ſome refocilation and eaſe vnto the anguiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. My wound then, quoth ſhe, in a word is this: I want faith; And what may be the ground, quoth I, of this perſwaſion? Becauſe, quoth ſhe, <hi>I am not aſſured that</hi> I <hi>am iuſtified and ſhall be ſaued:</hi> A weake ground, quoth I, ſeeing a man may haue Faith that wanteth ſuch Aſsurance; how may that be, quoth ſhe? for as hitherto I haue beene taught, Faith is no other then Aſsurance: then haue you beene taught amiſse, quoth I: and if this be all the ſcruple that troubleth you, <hi>I</hi> hope ere we part to finiſh the cure. Thereupon I began freely to declare what I conceiued of the <hi>true nature of iuſtifying Faith,</hi> and proued vnto her by ſundrie remonſtrances that <pb facs="tcp:10362:3"/> it was not <hi>Aſſurance</hi> but
<hi>Affiance,</hi> and with ſo good ſucceſse, that both ſhe and all that were preſent reſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with much comforted and contented. Only they prayed me both for their owne confirmation, and the farther informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, that I would be pleaſed to ſpeak of it againe in a more publike audience: wherevnto (ſeeing no reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me) I readily condeſcended, and on the text aforeſaid handled the matter ſomewhat largely.</p>
                  <p>This Sermon at leaſt ſo farre as concernes the Definition of Faith was by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baxter then preacher of that City greatly diſtaſted and diſliked: in ſo much as by meſsage he threatned me with open confutation thereof in the Pulpit, vnleſse I gaue him the ſpeedier &amp; better ſatisfaction; which threatning though I little feared, knowing <hi>I had built nor hay nor ſtubble vpon the foundation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.12.13.</note> but ſuch doctrines as were well able <hi>to endure the triall of the fire:</hi> yet becauſe the Apoſtle chargeth <hi>to be ready alwayes to giue anſwere to euery man that asketh a reaſon of the Hope that is in vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> I was eftſoones willing the beſt I could to ſatisfie him. Being therefore by the mediation of ſome friends brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with him, I prayed him to remember that whatſoeuer I ſayd in that Sermon was not barely affirmed but ſoundly proued, and therefore he might not in reaſon demaund ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of me vntill himſelfe had ſatisfied my reaſons: which if he ſhould ſubstantially doe, I would eaſe him of his Pulpit-confutation, and the ſame tongue that broched the errour, ſhould in the ſame place againe reuoke it. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>I</hi> to preſſe him with this argument, <hi>If faith be Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then God commanding a Reprobate to beleeue, commands him alſo to be aſſured,</hi> which is abſurd: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all his anſwere was, <hi>who art thou that diſputeſt with God? I</hi> replied,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.20.</note> that <hi>I</hi> neither diſputed with God nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled <pb facs="tcp:10362:4"/> his actions: but only denyed that <hi>God commands a Reprobate to be aſſured,</hi> for ſo he ſhould command that to be beleeued for true, which nor is nor euer ſhall be true. Againe I argued thus, <hi>If Faith be Aſſurance, then whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wanteth Aſſurance wanteth Faith, which to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoule is moſt vncomfortable.</hi> To this he anſwered that deſire of Aſſurance is in the acceptation of God as Aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it ſelfe. I replyed, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins</hi> being vrged with the ſame Obiection anſwered in the ſame manner, but vnſufficiently: for if actuall Faith be neceſsary to iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then is actuall Aſſurance alſo neceſſary if Faith be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: Here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Baxter</hi> would needs take occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate, why I ſhould preſume to define otherwiſe then <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Perkins,</hi> and ſo many worthy Divines had done before mee. Wherevnto I anſwered roundly and plainely, <hi>Socrates is deare,</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and Plato is deare, but truth is farre dearer:</hi> and therefore prayed him that leauing to oppoſe authority vnto reaſon, and ſounding names vnto ſound proofes, hee would returne againe within the lists, and either ſatisfie what I had ſaid, or giue mee leaue to proceed to the rest of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; But for this he craved, as then, to bee excuſed, pretending vrgent and inſtant buſineſſe, yet offering to haue our conference adiourned vnto ſome other day: I told him that the time of abſence (limited me from the
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> whereof I was then Fellow) was almoſt at an end; ſo that vnleſſe I would hazard my place I might make no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger stay there: nevertheleſſe if he pleaſed I would before my departure giue him my minde in writing, and attend his anſwere alſo in writing at his better leiſure: To this hee preſently condeſcended, holding it the fittest courſe, and promiſing (if I held my word with him) within one Moneth to returne me his full anſwere. I aſſured him that for my <pb facs="tcp:10362:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> part I would not faile him: and therevpon embracing one the other, and giuing hand that wee would proceed as wee had begun with all peace and loue, we brake off talke at that time and departed. The ſecond day after, according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I ſent him the Treatiſe following, <hi>Of the true nature &amp; definition of iuſtifying Faith,</hi> comprizing therein with ſome addition whatſoeuer touching the matter in queſtion I had more briefly deliuered in the Pulpit: and the next morning taking leaue of my friends, &amp; commending them to the grace of God in Chriſt I ſet forward for <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moneth being expired I looked out for my anſwere: for I could not thinke he would proue a bad pay-maſter, and breake day with me: But a moneth and a moneth and many other moneths followed after their predeceſſor, and all the while not a word from my <hi>Antagoniſt:</hi> which though in ſome Creditors it would haue bred ſuſpition, yet was I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay hold on the better handle, and to ſet the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction I could vpon his ouerlong ſilence,<note place="margin">Epiſt.

<hi>Agatharchus, he painted vnto Eternity:</hi> ſo <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baxter</hi> perhaps might the more ſlowely come off with his anſwere, that in the meane ſeaſon he might make it the more exact and accurate, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeldome ſeene that the ſame thing is both haſtily and exquiſitely done. But while I was thus ingenuouſly cenſuring his ſilence, and reſoluing yet further to forbeare him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that of Cato, Soone enough if well enough: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued certaine aduertiſement that he had erewhile broken ſilence, and diſperſed among his friends a most bitter and contumelious Invectiue againſt me, contrary both to his promiſe that he would proceed with all peace and charity, <pb facs="tcp:10362:5"/> and the reputation of learning he ſo much affects, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſend me a Copy thereof. Loth <hi>I</hi> was ſeeing
<hi>I</hi> haue not the rule of other mens pens, that others ſhould haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my affections: yet being ſo vrgently &amp; vnſchollerly dealt withall, the next time <hi>I</hi> paſsed through the City I could not but with ſome indignation challenge him for it to his face: At which time how he faltered and staggered in his tale, now confidently affirming he had by a friend conueyed his anſwer vnto me, &amp; by &amp; by being conteſted by the party, ſhamefully retracting it. Pretending for excuſe the loſſe of my paper, I appeale to them who then both ſaw and heard it. But this I ſay, that as his inconſtancy and distraction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed little friendſhip betwixt his heart &amp; tongue, &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued a ſelfe-guiltines of a poore and ſorry Reply: ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced loſſe of my paper was but a ſilly ſhift to delay me for the preſent, and as the euent ſhewes a miſerable tergiuerſation. For hauing a freſh offered within one moneth to ſend me an anſwere, and thereupon engaged both his credit and ſcholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip if he were ſupplied with another coppy: although the next day I left one for him vnder my hand, and now not one onely but twelue monthes are ſince fully finiſhed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, yet hath he hitherto beene to me ward as ſilent as mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: to me ward I ſay, for otherwiſe the libell still paſsed vnder hand, and at euery meeting made his diſciples good glee. Whereby it plainly appeareth, his meaning neuer was by an honest and christian entercourſe of writing to ſift out the truth: but onely by ſecret pamphletting to disparage me among his followers, that ſo himſelfe might riſe the higher, in the ballance of their eſtimation. For had he ſincerely and vnfainedly purpoſed the maintenance of Gods truth, and the reformation of my erronious iudgment, would he thus vncharitably haue played his prizes in the dark, and to
<pb facs="tcp:10362:5"/> michingly haue gone about to ſteale an opinion of victory? or would he not rather as became a right Champion of truth boldly haue confronted his aduerſary in the field, yea though hee had beene armed with no better weapon then a fillie ſling, as long as he came (for ſo he pretends) in the name of the Lord of Hoſts? But the truth is perceiuing himſelfe ſo farre aduanced into the battell that now without ſhame and confuſion hee might not retreat, hee held it the ſafeſt courſe by writing ſomething to make the world beleeue hee had duly performed with mee, and yet by limiting it vnto the hands of a few of his truſtieſt friends to depriue mee of all poſsibility of anſwering for my ſelfe, reſting aſſured that my ſilence would be taken to proceed rather of weaknes and inſufficiencie in me, then any neceſsitie by his cunning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced vpon mee.

                  <p>But at length the night-raven fell into the ſnare, and by the watchfulneſſe of my good friends in <hi>Briſtow</hi> I obtained ſuch a
<hi>Copie</hi> thereof as with all his ſhifts and excuſes hee cannot poſsibly diſclaime, being indeed ſubſcribed with his owne hand. Perhaps you may think it found me when I first receaued it, ſtrongly foreſtalled and poſſeſſed with preiudice: and indeed his baſe and vnworthie dealing deſerued no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For how could I entertaine any indifferent conceit of that whereof the authors ſelfe ſeemed to bee aſhamed? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe before I began to pervſe it, ſo farre prevailed I over my affections, that I throughly cleered them of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie <pb facs="tcp:10362:6"/> and preſumption, yea and grew ſo rigorous &amp; vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall againſt my ſelfe, that I was content to ſuppoſe I might be in error, and he happily the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> to cure the diſeaſe of my iudgement, reſolving if I might plainely be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take vnto me Christian ſeverity and recant the ſame. For if I may not hope in this life to aſpire to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wiſdome, yet would I willingly riſe to ſome degree of modeſty: that if I may not in all things ſay that which is not to be repented of, yet I may at least repent me of what I haue ſaid amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>In this temper and diſpoſition I tooke the booke, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mine eye vpon the front thereof, there I found it thus inſcribed.

Thirdly and lastly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of others, and among the reſt thoſe my good friends eſpecially who occaſioned the preaching of this doctrine, partly to preſerue from recidiuation ſuch as by the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſse thereof were recouered out of great diſtreſse, and partly to preuent others from falling into the like perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Although therefore I denie not but that good houres beſtowed vpon ſo bad a ſubiect might haue beene more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably employed, eſpecially conſidering that by the violent ſtruggling thereof againſt the rooke of truth, it hath whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie turned it ſelfe into froth, and hath not ſo much as a drop <pb facs="tcp:10362:8"/> of cleere reaſon in it: yet notwithſtanding for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and that it may perfectly appeare how ſtedfaſt and vnmoued the rocke ſtands, and how little the ſtormes and tempeſts raiſed againſt it haue preuailed vpon it, I haue thought good to skim away the fome of Sophistrie wrought about it, and to diſcouer the very ground whereon it is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Which when I ſhall haue done, I doubt not, howſoeuer my aduerſary with his tong-valiantnes and ſwelling words may haue made vnexperienced folke belieue that with the breath of his mouth hee is able to driue whole armies of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments before him: yet I ſhall approue euen to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of preiudice it ſelfe that whatſoeuer in this windie &amp; wordie Pamphlet he hath vented againſt me is vainer then vanitie it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And thus, Chriſtian Reader, haue I at length fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted thee with the whole ſtory both of the originall and progreſse of this controuerſie.

                     <hi>and his wine is tempered with water,</hi> neither hath he receiued ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit as to know all things, or to be exempted from poſsibility of erring: but <hi>God is light and in him is no darkneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.5.</note> and truth is vnto him ſo neceſsary and eſsentiall as it is impoſsible hee ſhould <hi>either deceiue or be deceiued,</hi> it implying contradiction with his nature. And therefore the priuilege of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity belonging vnto him alone, to him alone belongeth alſo the prerogatiue of ſupreme iudicature: ſo that whatſoeuer <pb facs="tcp:10362:8"/> he ſaith, is ſimply and abſolutely to bee belieued, whereas the ſayings of men are by his word to be tried and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

<hi>Standard of truth,</hi> and the only vnmoued <hi>Principle</hi> into which all <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of Faith</hi> are finally to bee reſolued, boldly exact the writings of other men thereunto, and meekely ſubmit their owne to be cenſured thereby.

From the writings and doctrine of moſt learned and worthy Diuines peraduenture it doth, and indeed it doth vary: to whom although as farre farre <pb n="3" facs="tcp:10362:10"/> inferior I owe all reſpect &amp; reuerence, yet being Gods freeman I cannot endure to bee mans bond-man and ſweare to all they ſay.

                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Fides Hiſtoriae,</hi> Hiſtoricall Faith, which is an Aſſent of the mind vnto the truth of Gods word, and ſpecially the Goſpell. And this Faith whether it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtinction of the Scoolemen, Acquiſite, gotten by much hearing and experience without

                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10362:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>The ſecond is <hi>Fides Promiſsionum,</hi> Faith of promiſes, which is a <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or
<hi>Aſsurance</hi> that the promiſes of God made in Chriſt, to wit
<hi>Iustification,</hi> Remiſſion of ſinnes, Adoption, Regeneration, and finally Election it ſelfe, and eternall Saluation doe particularly pertaine to me, and are mine. Now this although I deny not but in Scripture it is called faith, and that euery Saint of God both may and ought to haue this particular perſwaſion and Aſſurance, yet this I confidently deny that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is that which juſtifies a man before God; and my reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this were <hi>juſtifying</hi> Faith, then whoſoeuer liues and dyes without this particular <hi>Aſsurance,</hi> he cannot be ſaued,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> But a man may be ſaued without it; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe our Brethren of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who hold that faith may finally and totally fall away, and conſequently that there can be no certainty of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, whom yet the Church of God calleth and counteth brethren, and it were vncharitable to cenſure of them otherwiſe. Therefore, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe probably Faith is not an Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is in time after <hi>Iuſtifying</hi> Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that faith. This is vndeniable. But this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge is in time after faith. This I proue out of 1. Ioh. 5.13. <hi>Theſe things haue I written vnto you that beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God, that ye may know that ye haue eternall life.</hi> Behold <hi>Beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> goes before, and
<hi>Knowledge</hi> comes after: as for that which followeth in the ſame verſe, <hi>and that yee may beleeue,</hi> I interpret it of
<hi>Perſeuerance</hi> &amp; growth in <hi>Faith.</hi> Howſoeuer,
<hi>beleeuing</hi> &amp; <hi>Knowing</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10362:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> and therefore are not one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which in nature comes after Iuſtification cannot be Iuſtifying faith. This appeares becauſe Faith is the Efficient inſtrumentall cauſe of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and euery Efficient by the rule of Logick is in nature before the Effect. But this knowledge or Aſſurance is in nature after iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This I proue thus, the truth of a propoſition is alwayes in nature before the knowledge of the truth: for Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not therefore true becauſe knowne ſo, but they are firſt true and then knowne ſo. Therefore this Propoſition, I know I am iuſtified ſpoken by on that is iuſtified, muſt needs preſuppoſe the partie before to be iuſtified. Therefore this knowledge of Iuſtification in nature following Iuſtification it cannot be Iuſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In conditionall promiſes there can be no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the thing promiſed before the performance of the condition. V. G. This is a conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the couenant of workes, doe this and thou ſhalt liue, life is promiſed, but on condition of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and therefore vntill we haue performed the condition, we cannot, nor may not looke that God ſhould be reciprocall and giue vs life: So in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, iuſtification is promiſed, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of faith: ſo ſayth the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and thy ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen thee. And therefore the condition of beleeuing muſt firſt be performed before we can aſſure our ſelues our ſins are forgiuen. If ſo, then faith going before and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance following after, Aſſurance cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10362:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>5 That from whence followeth a blaſphemous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity cannot be a truth: for from truth nought but truth can be concluded. But from this that faith is an Aſſurance ſuch an abſurdity doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. What is that? That God commands a man to know an vntruth, &amp; to aſſure himſelfe of that which neuer ſhall be. For God being truth cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand falſhood to be taken for truth. Nether tell me here, for who art thou that diſputeſt with God? for this is a ruled caſe in diuinity, God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not doe things which imply contradiction, and therefore not make vntruth to be truth, or knowledge error. Now that this abſurdity followes from hence thus I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it. God commands the Reprobate to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: For,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18.8.9.</note> for vnbeleefe the world ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: but no condemnation but for breach of a commandement:<note place="margin">1 Ioh.3.4.</note> for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Sinne is the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the law, and therefore they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to beleeue. I aske you then what it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? you will ſay, to know, to aſſure. Therefore God commands the Reprobates to know and bee aſſured. But this is a blaſphemous abſurdity: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is your opinion abſurd which infers it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which the wicked may haue cannot be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith: for it is <hi>Fides Electorum,</hi> the faith of the Elect. But the wicked may haue this perſwaſion, yea and many haue beene moſt confidently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they are in the fauour of God. You will ſay it is no true perſwaſion: but I ſay if forme make truth they are as formally and therefore as truly perſwaded of it as the godly. And therefore if the godly are therefore and for this cauſe iuſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10362:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſe they are ſtrongly perſwaded that they are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: then why ſhould not the wicked likewiſe be iuſtified by his ſtrong perſwaſion? But in truth theſe kind of ſpeeches are vnreaſonable and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſo the opinion cannot be reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſixe reaſons ſhall ſuffice for the preſent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many more might be added: only from hence I gather this Corollary, that if iuſtifying Faith be not a Knowledge or Aſſurance, much leſſe is it a full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or full Aſſurance. Nay though we ſhould graunt it to be a knowledge, yet is it againſt Logick to define it by the perfection of knowledg. For as there is a ſtrong tree ſo there is a bruſed reed: as there is a burning lamp, ſo there is ſmoking flaxe: as there is
<gap reason="foreign">

So therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it were to exclude the weake Faith, and to make the Definition narrower and of leſſe latitude then the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Beſides it is a moſt diſcomfortable doctrine vnto a troubled mind, and leads the directeſt way to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for ſo the palſie hand of Faith ſhould not receiue Chriſt.

So that theſe three Faiths ſhall bee as the three Propoſitions of a Categoricke Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, Faith of Story being the Maior, Faith of Perſon or Perſonall merit being the Aſſumption, and Faith of Promiſes being the Concluſion, on this wiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De-</hi> Whoſoeuer ſhall (as formerly is declared) reſt vpon the merits of Chriſt for his Iuſtification and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10362:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> Saluation, he ſhall be iuſtified and ſaued: This the Scripture affirmeth, and to acknowledge the truth thereof is Hiſtoricall Faith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ri.</hi> But I doe ſo reſt vpon Chriſt; This the Conſcience priuy to the ſincerity of the heart aſſumeth, which act of Reſting I tearme Iuſtifying Faith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>j.</hi> Therefore I am iuſtified &amp; ſhall be ſaued. And this is the Faith of Promiſe concluded of the former premiſſes, and is the Aſſurance before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>To draw to a Concluſion, concerning theſe three Faiths I adde farther, that to the Faith of Story many doe not aſpire, namely ſuch Paynims and Gentiles to whom God hath not vouchſafed the Miniſtery of the Word and meanes of knowledge: yet many Reprobates doe, liuing within the compaſſe and territory of the Church, and remaine for all that vniuſtified. Vnto the Faith of Perſon, and that Affiance which I call ſleight and ſuperficiall, many likewiſe of the veſſels of wrath doe attaine, but cannot goe one ſtep farther, whereas all and euery of the Elect reſt on Chriſt in the ſecond man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and vpon the precedents before ſpecified, and are thereby iuſtified. Vnto the Faith of promiſe though the children of God may come, and moſt do come, yet ſome doubtleſſe partly through the ſtrength of fleſh, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of infidelity with their Faith, partly through the force and violence of temptation, doe not nor dare not inferre the Concluſion, and yet may be iuſtified.</p>

                     <p>In word you promiſe orderly proceeding, but indeed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10362:24"/> you lay the foundation of Babel, and by peruerting the ſtate of the Queſtion diſorder and confound the whole Diſputation. For whereas I inquire <hi>What is the true Nature and definition of iuſtifying Faith,</hi> and determine that that act whereby a man ſtands iuſtified before God, is not Aſſurance in the Mind but Affiance in the Will: you to foreſtall the reader on your ſide, and to worke all the preiudice you can againſt mee, ſubſtitute inſteed thereof this enuious demaund,
<hi>Whether iuſtifying Faith by the Church for</hi> 1600. <hi>yeeres bee rightly defined,</hi> and boldly auerre that I maintaine it negatiuely &amp; you affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuely. How you can quit your ſelfe of manifeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarication herein I ſee not, vnles perhaps you ſay that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit directly &amp; in preciſe tearmes I affirme not ſo much: yet defining otherwiſe then the Church hitherto hath done, indirectly and by conſequence I auouch no leſſe; But this figleafe is not broad enough to couer your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. For ſuppoſe it were ſo, yet was it your dutie to haue retained the Queſtion in that very forme of words I propounded it vnto you, and not in lieu of my Concluſion to place a Conſectary of your owne colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If whereas you hold that Faith is Aſſurance, I ſhould ſtate the Queſtion thus, <hi>Whether God commaund a lie to bee beleeued as true,</hi> and then peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that you affirme it and I deny it, would you not think your ſelfe much wronged and abuſed? And yet this abſurditie neceſſarily following vpon that opinion, as in my fift Argument is firmely proued: I ſhould ſo doing but ſerue you with your owne ſauce and repay you in your owne coine. How forcible therefore ſoeuer your Conſequence may be, in this place it is very vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and with more credit ſhould you haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <pb n="32" facs="tcp:10362:25"/> your promiſe of orderly proceeding, if you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it thither where you meane to argue againſt mee.

                     <p>Neuertheleſſe becauſe you vaunt ſo much and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all the learned men of Chriſtendome, all the Church, all the world, all Fathers, all Writers, old and new, Greeke and Latin for theſe 1600. yeeres: giue mee leaue in this place once for all to apply mine anſwer thereunto. I ſay therefore that it is but a vaine and idle brag full of Arrogance, Temerity, and Vntruth; Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in that you would ſeeme to haue read all Authors that haue wrtten theſe 1600. yeeres: which if you were ſuch a glutton of bookes, and withall had the ſtrength of an oke and the time of <hi>Mathuſelah;</hi> yet could you not by any meanes performe: Temerity in that you thinke with the countenance of one inartificiall argument, to outbraue ſo many ſound Demonſtrations grounded on Gods Word and according with right reaſon: Vntruth, in that you beare the world in hand as if all Writers both old and new were cleerely againſt me, not ſo much as one giuing his ſuffrage and voice with mee, whereas in my Treatiſe I haue expreſly ſhewed the contrary.</p>
                     <p>For firſt touching the Negatiue, that Faith is not Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, I vouched therein the authority of that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and worthy man of God <hi>M. Foxe,</hi> whoſe words anon you ſhall heare at large: In the meane ſeaſon it behooueth you, if you will bee beleeued in this point, to produce the cloud of witneſſes you ſo much boaſt of, that wee may heare whether they will depoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory hereunto, namely that Faith is Aſſurance. <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10362:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> For howſoeuer, you ſay you haue no fewer then All, yet it may bee when all comes to all you will proue as ill ſtored of teſtimonies as the wiſe man of <hi>Athens</hi> was of ſhipping, who being not worth the pooreſt ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop in the harbor, bare himſelfe notwithſtanding for owner of all the gallies that arriued therein. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hauing throughly ſearched your Anſwer to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I find the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber (by you cited) ſo ſmall, that I need not much skill in Arithmetike to ſumme them vp: for, the totall amounts to no more then an Vnity, and all your Authors are but one <hi>Caluin,</hi> once alledged in the front thereof. Vnto whom I denie not but you might haue ioyned ſome other of the later Writers: but what are they to all both old and new for 1600. yeeres? For as for the ancient Fathers, not one of them (ſo farre as I can learne) affirmeth the iuſtifying act of Faith to be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: and among the Moderne it is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that a good part of them flatly denyeth it. So that being backed of ſo few, and yet craking ſo loudly of All,<note place="margin">Ter. Eunuch. act. 4. Scen. 7.</note> you play right the glorious Souldier in the Comedie, who hauing but foure men in all the world, beſtirred himſelfe ſo buſily with three of them as if hee had been muſtering a whole Legion, and at length miſſing the fourth, gallantly demaunded where all the reſt were.</p>
                     <p>Againe touching the Affirmatiue, that Faith is Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I quoted that paſſage of S. <hi>Augustin, To beleeue is to loue, ad by louing to moue vnto God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe De morib. Eccl. ca.

                        <hi>and he that beleeueth not commeth not: for we run not vnto Chriſt by walking but beleeuing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come we by the motion of the body, but by the wil of the heart.</hi> So that Faith being in <hi>S.

                        <hi>ſtretcheth out his heart towards God.</hi> And <hi>what doth it?

In a word all thoſe who ſeat it only or principally in the will,<note place="margin">Colloq. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</note> accord with mee. For although defining it popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they put vſually into their Deſcriptions, <hi>Aſsent vnto ſupernaturall verities</hi> which is an act of the mind: yet making not that, but Affiance only the proper act that iuſtifies, they doe in effect fully accord and agree with me. So that you ſee I am not driuen to ſo neere an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but vnto your one I can oppoſe more then you are aware of.

So that if your kind of reaſoning may paſſe for currant, great danger and error muſt needs enſue vpon it.

Whereunto though I haue already ſufficiently anſwered, yet now I adde by way of ſurplus, that many Truths lye a long time hidden in their principles, and vnheeded of the wiſeſt, which being at length diſcloſed and brought to light, are not therefore new in themſelues, but onely vnto vs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming newly vnto our knowledge: euen as the countrey of
<hi>America</hi> is called the new world, not becauſe it is of a latter creation then <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> but only becauſe it is of a later diſcouery. Theſe Concluſions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their dependency and coherence with the principles doe manifeſtly appeare vnto vs, it ſufficeth to beleeue them implicitly and in the preparation of the Minde: but when they ſhall bee vnfolded out of their principles, and clearly demonſtrated vnto vs by neceſſary deduction from them, we are bound to yeeld diſtinct and expreſſe aſſent vnto them.

                        <hi>are wont to diſtinguiſh three faiths, of hiſtory, of miracles, of promiſes:</hi> but <hi>Catholicks teach that they are one and the ſame Faith, and that iuſtifying Faith.</hi> But doth not the Apoſtle (in the place here quoted by you) auouch that there is but one Faith? yes verily: but thereby in the iudgement of the beſt Diuines hee meaneth, not that Faith whereby wee doe belieue, but that which we doe belieue: that is not the Habit but the Obiect of Faith, as if hee ſhould more plainely ſay, <hi>there is but one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> And although in regard of the variety and multitude of materiall obiects, there may ſeeme to bee not one but many Faiths: yet becauſe the formall reaſon wherefore we doe belieue them is but one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuine teſtimony, and they are in ſuch ſort linked and woouen together that one Article cannot bee denied without the diſſolution of the whole Creed, all being according to the old rule one copulatiue, it is therefore rightly and iuſtly called one Faith.</p>
                     <p>Finally where you ſay <hi>Faith comprehendeth my three nice diſtinctions, and is compounded of them all,</hi> I anſwer that ſuch compoſition is altogether impoſſible: for Faith of Story, and Faith of Promiſe are in the Vnderſtanding, but Faith of Perſon is in the Will, and it cannot be that one and the ſame Habit ſhould bee ſubiectiuely in two ſeuerall faculties of ſo different natures. For the Habit that is for example in <hi>Peter</hi> is one in number and that which is one in number is indiuiſible, and that which is indiuiſible cannot bee at once in two Subiects, becauſe as Philoſophie teacheth Numeration is from the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Subiects.

But you after the manner of thoſe Gladiators called

                     <p>Neither doe I vſe ſuch circumguagues, nor wiredraw my arguments into ſuch a length as you beare vs in hand: but hauing nakedly and plainely defined what Hiſtoricall Faith is, I proue by two reaſons that Faith ſo defined doth not iuſtifie, the firſt whereof is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>abſurd that ſo generall a Knowledge ſhould iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</hi> So that your <hi>Ferio</hi> Syllogiſme deſerues a <hi>Ferula,</hi> and vtterly to bee caſhed, as being no creature of mine, but an idle figment of your owne: and the next in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larent (for ſo you forme it, although indeed it bee alſo in <hi>Ferio,</hi> the Minor propoſition and Concluſion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your generall notes being but particular enuntiations) is the onely Syllogiſme intended by mee, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:10362:36"/> and including my firſt argument. The Maior whereof it ſeemes you grant ſaying nothing vnto it: and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor only you deny, which I cannot but wonder at, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Minor and Concluſion are vniuerſally vouched by all the Diuines of our ſide. The Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that Hiſtoricall Faith iuſtifies not: So ſaith Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,<note place="margin">De fide Hom. iuſtificandi.</note>
                        <hi>There is a certaine Historicall Faith whereby thoſe things which are propounded in holy writ are ſimply belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but yet is not applyed vnto Christ and the matter of our Saluation.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Loco de Fide.</note> The Minor is that Hiſtoricall Faith is a generall Knowledge: So ſayth Kemnitius, <hi>There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall Faith which vſually is tearmed Hiſtoricall:</hi> and againe, <hi>Hiſtoricall Faith is a generall aſſent holding in generall that the promiſe of the Goſpell is true.</hi> And M. Perkins,<note place="margin">Ser. cauſ. c. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>A generall Faith whereby they giue aſſent vnto the Goſpell.</hi> Neither doe I know any one of our Diuines that either in the Concluſion or the Minor doth gainſay them. So that by the iudgement of theſe men, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to Gods Word in generall, and to the Goſpell in ſpeciall, is not a Speciall but Generall Knowledge: and if the Speciality of the Goſpell being but a part of the whole Scripture did ſpecify Faith, it would follow thereupon that there are as many Speciall Faiths as there are ſeuerall Articles of the Creed, which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to imagine. For that Faith which aſſenteth vnto the Goſpell is no other then that which aſſenteth vnto the reſt of holy Scripture: and although it may principally reſpect that part of diuine truth, yet doth it not only reſpect it, nor is limited thereunto as vnto the proper adequate obiect thereof, but vniuerſally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe vnto all ſupernaturall reuealed verities whatſoeuer. As for that Faith which our Diuines call
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10362:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> Speciall, is to be vnderſtood of Faith of Promiſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saints apply and appropriate them vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, particularly and indiuidually aſſuring themſelues of their preſent iuſtification and future ſaluation. And the ignorance hereof as I ween is the cauſe why you turne generall into ſpeciall and write of this matter ſo wildly and confuſedly.</p>
                     <p>This notwithſtanding very peremptorily you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that
<hi>Hiſtoriall Faith is a ſpeciall Knowledge,</hi> and thereupon Syllogiſtically inferre that it is the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Iustifying Faith:</hi> to what end I wot not well, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it bee to proue that it doth iuſtify becauſe as you conclude it is the beginning of that Faith. But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer your intent bee, your argument I anſwer by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the word Beginning. For if you vnderſtand thereby a Pre-requiſite or Preparatiue vnto iuſtifying Faith, you doe but fight with a ſhadow, for in that ſence I grant the Concluſion, neither doth ſuch a beginning of Iuſtifying Faith iuſtify. If you meane thereby that it is Iuſtifying Faith inchoat and in a remiſſer degree, then I deny your Maior, and ſay that ſuch a knowledge (call it as you pleaſe generall or ſpeciall) is not the beginning of iuſtifying Faith; If it were, then Diuels and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates hauing it ſhould haue iuſtifying Faith which Gods Word attributes vnto the Elect onely.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> And if it bee true that Faith of perſon is the conſummation of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith as in the former ſection you ſay, it cannot bee that ſuch a knowledge ſhould bee the Beginning thereof: vnleſſe you will ſay that Accidents may paſſe from one Subiect to another, which is againſt all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. For Hiſtoricall Faith is in the Vnderſtanding, and Faith of Perſon is in the Will: and therefore Faith <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10362:37"/> of Story beginning in the Mind can haue no ſubſiſtence elſewhere, and iuſtifying Faith being perfected in the Will cannot bee begunne in any other Subiect. The paſſages quoted in the margent though you ſhould rack them till they rent aſunder, yet will they not confeſſe what you alledge them for. For how I pray you hang theſe things together? <hi>To you it is giuen to know the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdome of heauen; This is life euerlaſting to know thee; Fleſh and Bloud hath not reuealed this vnto thee but my Father,</hi> Ergo <hi>Such a knowledge is iuſtifying Faith begun.</hi> This is too violent aſtraining of Scripture, and as <hi>Voluſian</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>is not a ſucking of milke, but drawing of bloud from the dugs of the Church.</hi>

That there is but one Faith you ſay it is nouelty not to grant, and that, Faith only iuſtifies I think you dare not deny: how is it then that in the margent forgetting your ſelfe you talke of three kinds of Faith, which except my Arithmetike faile mee are more then one? and ioyne fellowes with that in iuſtification in the body of your text, which yet you confeſſe doth onely iuſtify? But what is it that comes not within the ſphere of your omnipotent Philoſophie? The power of your Logicke hath already contracted Vniuerſall into Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and why then may not the ſubtlety of your Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicke find a plurality alſo in an Vnity?</p>
                     <p>But to be plaine with you, I ſay that Hiſtoricall Faith is ſo far from being a ioint cauſe that at all properly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Iuſtification, but onely as I haue ſaid a Pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or Preparatiue thereunto. True it is that Faith of Perſon is neuer Solitary, but is euer conioyned with ſundry other graces, and among the reſt with Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Faith: yet are not their operations to bee confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe in the ſame perſon they are conioyned. Many ſeeds lye in my hand together, yet euery one hath his ſeuerall and diſtinct vertue: Faith of Perſon is neuer without Faith of Story, yet it is Faith of Perſon which onely iuſtifies. And as in the generation of man, the <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10362:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> Senſitiue ſoule goes before, and prepares a fit organ for the infuſion of the Reaſonable, and yet not the Senſitiue but the Reaſonable only doth informe: ſo in the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, Faith of Story proceeds, and makes way for the inducement of Faith of Perſon, and yet not Faith of Story but Faith of Perſon only doth iuſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Now whether in ſpeaking thus abſolutely I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnlearnedly as you ſay or no, it skilleth not much, ſeeing I am ſure I haue ſpoken truly.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.9.</note> What euer I am, by the grace of God I am, and deſire ſo to bee vnto his glory.

                        <hi>O yee noble Schollers marke this Syllogiſme: I haue made your arguments hitherto for you</hi> Maſter Downe, <hi>and in this creeping and incroching argument tell you that you beg the matter in question. For I deny that your definition of Historicall Faith is a generall knowledge, but ſpeciall and peculiar vnto the Elect in the beginning of their iuſtifying Faith, conioyned with the Application, and Resting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ and his merits. And to bee plaine with you I tell you it is ridiculous yea blaſphemous to ſay that Diuels haue Faith, or that euer</hi> Balaam, Iudas, <hi>or</hi> Magus <hi>had Faith. And ſo telleth you M. Caluin,</hi>

                        <hi>and alſo telleth you,</hi> Abundé conſtat totam hanc diſputationem de fide non haberi, <hi>it is plaine that this whole diſputation</hi> Iam. 2. <hi>is not about Faith. Let this therefore ſerue for an anſwer I pray you to your firſt distinction of Historicall Faith, which you confound with a vulgar knowledge as appeareth before: knowing this, No man that finally contemneth this Speciall knowledge of Gods Word and ſpecially the Goſpell can be ſaued. For hee can neuer haue the other two kinds of Faith ſpoken of before, except he begin with this kind of Faith.</hi>

                     <speaker>I. D.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely I am very deeply beholding vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip, hauing ſo ſmall skill in Logicke, that you will bee pleaſed to forme my arguments, and to ſhape them in ſo excellent faſhion for mee. But I beſeech you ſpare your paines where you are like to reape little thanks for your labour. Such officiouſneſſe in an aduerſary is not without ſuſpicion: and if you may haue the hammering of my arguments, your weakeſt anſwers I doubt not will be proofe inough againſt them. Leaue me therfore I pray you to the meaning of my own weapons, and looke you well vnto your owne defence; for I feare mee you will hardly bee able to auoid the danger of them. For thus I reaſon, <hi>That Faith which Diuels and Reprobates haue, iustifies not: Hiſtoricall Faith Diuels and Reprobates haue,</hi> Ergo
<hi>Hiſtoricall Faith iuſtifies not.</hi> Here you ſee nor creeping, nor incroching, but faire and plaine dealing and ſuch as I am well content all noble Schollers marke it. But let vs ſee what you reioyne hereunto.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you ſay I beg the matter in Queſtion. What matter? that Hiſtoricall Faith is a generall knowledge; but neither is that the matter now in Queſtion, neither doe I any way beg it. For in this Syllogiſme the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether Hiſtoricall Faith doe iuſtify, of your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion there appeares nor palme nor footſtep: which yet in the former ſection againſt your negatiue I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to bee moſt true. That which you adde if it bee not ſenſeleſſe is contrary both to your ſelfe and vnto reaſon. For ſaying that Hiſtoricall Faith is proper and ſpeciall vnto the Elect in the beginning of their iuſtifying Faith,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10362:39"/> you plainely diſtinguiſh it from iuſtifying Faith, which is contrary to what you haue elſewhere ſaid. If you ſtill confound them and make Hiſtoricall Faith the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Iuſtifying Faith, it is as if you ſhould ſay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of iuſtifying Faith, is ſpeciall and peculiar vnto the Elect in the beginning of their iuſtifying Faith, which is altogether witleſſe and ſenſeleſſe. Laſtly, to ſay that Hiſtoricall Faith which before was Generall and common as ſoone as it is conioyned with applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reſting on Chriſt becomes ſpeciall and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, is vtterly void of reaſon. For as Grace ſuperadded vnto Nature in the Elect makes not Nature ſpeciall and peculiar vnto them, but that ſtill it remaines common vnto all men: ſo alſo Hiſtoricall Faith by acceſſion of Iuſtifying Faith or Affiance changeth not its nature and becomes Speciall, but as it was euermore continues Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Generall I ſay, both Obiectiuely as ſtretching it ſelfe vnto all ſupernaturall reuealed verities: and Subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely not being appropriated vnto the Elect onely, but commonly incident vnto others alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly you deny the Minor, telling mee plainely that <hi>it is ridiculous yea blaſphemous to ſay that Diuels haue Faith, or that euer Balaam, Iudas, or Magus had Faith.</hi> If I ſhould now temper my inke with ſome ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ingredient, and in the zeale of my affection ſay vnto you as the Angell ſometime ſaid vnto Satan,<note place="margin">Iude 9.</note>
                        <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> it were no more then here you iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. For it is not holy and learned men alone (which yet were too impudent) but euen the ſpirit of Wiſdome and truth himſelfe whom (I tremble to ſpeake it) you charge with ridiculouſnes and blaſphemie. For doth not the Holy Ghoſt by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in expreſſe tearmes ſay, <pb n="62" facs="tcp:10362:40"/> 
                        <hi>The Diuels belieue and tremble?</hi> and by Saint Luke, <hi>Then Simon himſelfe alſo belieued?</hi>

And what Orthodoxe Diuine is there ancient or moderne who falling vpon this queſtion doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Diuels and Reprobates doe Hiſtorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belieue?<note place="margin">De vnico Bapt. cont.

                        <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> is bold and compareth the Faith of Diuels confeſſing Chriſt, <hi>Wee know thee who thou art, euen the Sonne of God,</hi> with that memorable confeſſion of Peter, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Sonne of the liuing God. This confeſsion,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>was fruitfull vnto Peter, but pernicious vnto the Diuels, yet in both not falſe but true, not to bee denied but acknowledged, not to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted but approued.</hi> And a little after hauing vouched that of <hi>Saint Iames,</hi> the Diuels belieue and tremble, and compared therewith the Faith of thoſe who belieue the truth of God but liue wickedly, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Wee haue found out of the Church not onely certaine men, but Diuels alſo confeſſing the ſame Faith of one God, yet both confirmed by the Apostles rather then denied.</hi> Of the ſame iudgement are our latter writers, <hi>That Faith is attributed to Simon Magus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Inſt. lib. 3. ca. 2. §. 10.</note> ſaith Caluin, <hi>We vnderſtand not with ſome that hee fained in words a Faith which was not in his heart, but thinke rather that being ouercome by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of the Goſpell, hee did in a ſort belieue and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ to be the Author of Life and Saluation. Simon,</hi> ſaith Beza,<note place="margin">In Act. 8.13. On the Creed. Anſ. to Rhem. T. in Iam. 2.6.</note>
                        <hi>belieued with Hiſtoricall Faith. Hiſtoricall Faith,</hi> ſaith Perkins, <hi>is in the Diuell and his Angels. Such a Faith,</hi> ſaith Fulke,
<hi>as is in Diuels, namely an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that there is one God, and ſo likewiſe of all the reſt of the Articles of Faith to bee true, without trust or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <pb n="63" facs="tcp:10362:40"/> in God.</hi> Finally, the whole Church of Auſpurg, <hi>Whereas Saint Iames ſaith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Harm. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ.</note> 
                        <hi>the Diuels belieue and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee ſpeaketh of an Historicall Faith: Now this Faith doth not iuſtifie; for the Diuels and the wicked are cunning in the Hiſtory.</hi> Which laſt words I would wiſh you to note and obſerue. For if Hiſtoricall Faith bee no other then an aſſent of the Mind vnto the truth of Gods Word, then Diuels and Reprobates ſo aſſenting, yea being cunning in the Story, muſt needs haue Hiſtoricall Faith. Adde hereunto, that if they doe not ſo much as Hiſtorically belieue, then the ſinnes which they commit againſt the Goſpell are onely ſinnes of ignorance and not againſt knowledge, neither can they offend of malice, or fall into that vnpardonable ſinne which is againſt the Holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.32.</note> Neither laſtly can any bee ſaid to haue <hi>made ſhipwracke of Faith,</hi> which yet the Scripture ſaith ſome haue done,<note place="margin">1 Tim.
1.19.</note> vnleſſe perhaps you will ſay a man may make ſhipwracke of that which hee neuer had. So that now if I haue ſpoken ridiculouſly and blaſphemouſly as you ſay, you ſee what Schoolemaſters haue deceiued me, and vpon what reaſons I haue been drawne into this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impiety: or rather the world ſees what folly it is in you thus againſt all reaſon to impute <hi>blaſphemy and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſneſſe</hi> vnto the truth of God, and the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preachers and defenders thereof.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Caluin,</hi> you ſay, telleth mee it is
<hi>ridiculous to ſay that Diuels haue Faith,</hi> and, it is <hi>plaine that this whole diſputation Iam.</hi> 2. <hi>is not about Faith.</hi> But is it poſſible that <hi>Caluin</hi> ſhould ſtriue againſt the torrent of ſo maine authority? or like the Philoſopher of whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh forget, his owne voice, and vnſay that which he had formerly ſaid? Certainly if you wil giue him leaue to <pb n="64" facs="tcp:10362:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> bee the interpreter of his owne meaning you ſhall find hee doth not. For when hee denieth that Diuels haue Faith, and that <hi>Saint Iames</hi> there diſputeth of Faith, hee vnderſtandeth not Faith indefinitely, but particularly iuſtifying Faith. This is euident by his annotation on the twentieth verſe,<note place="margin">In Iam. 2.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Here,</hi> ſaith hee,
<hi>is no diſputation of the cauſe of Iuſtification,</hi> whereby what other can hee meane then Iuſtifying Faith: And when hee ſaith <hi>the diſpute is not about Faith,</hi> hee addeth forthwith, <hi>but of a vulgar knowledge which conioyneth a man to God no more then the ſight of the Sunne lifts him to Heauen.</hi> Now what is that Faith which vnites vs vnto God, but onely Iuſtifying Faith? and what is this vulgar knowledge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Hiſtoricall Faith, by which the eye of the mind ſees diuine truth as that of the body ſees the Sunne? Of that therefore by <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not,<note place="margin">Beza in eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem locum.</note> of this hee doth. And <hi>Beza</hi> who vpon this place treadeth in <hi>Caluins</hi> ſteps and well knew his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning affirmeth that Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> vnderſtandeth not the ſame Faith whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith wee are iuſtified, but onely that whereby wee doe belieue there is a God, and that Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and that all things preſcribed in both the teſtaments are true, which is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the very definition of Hiſtoricall Faith. But for all your prayſing of <hi>Caluin,</hi> you cannot bee contented with his expoſition, but you muſt needs haue a tricke beyond him. For whereas hee by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Faith vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a
<hi>vulgar knowledge,</hi> you will rather haue it to be <hi>a peculiar ſhew by miracles,</hi> which is the moſt ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe deuice that euer was imagined. For who euer drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the Queſtion which there the Apoſtle diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſhould bee this, <hi>Whether a peculiar ſhew by miracles
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10362:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> without works doe iustifie?</hi> And when hee ſaith <hi>Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueſt there is one God, thou doest well; the Diuels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue alſo and tremble,</hi> what brute of <hi>Cuma</hi> or
<hi>Arcadia</hi> would expound it thus, <hi>Thou haſt a peculiar ſhew by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is well, the Diuels haue a peculiar ſhew by miracles alſo and tremble?</hi> Learne therefore and know that the Faith which Diuels haue, cannot bee Faith of miracles: for miracles the Diuels can worke none, being limited within the compaſſe of their nature which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſupernaturall effects, and neuer being ordained to bee the confirmers of Faith, to which end mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were appointed. Now then to end this point, whereas you pray this may ſerue for an anſwer vnto my firſt diſtinction of Hiſtoricall Faith, I muſt tell you plainly that what you cannot win by force, you are not like to get by begging; neither can I at any hand bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to accept of friuolous and deſperate ſpeeches, for ſound and ſubſtantiall anſwers. Whereas againe you make the ground of my error as you pretend to bee <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of Hiſtoricall Faith with a vulgar knowledge,</hi> You ſhall by your patience giue mee leaue ſtill to erre that error, vntill by ſome new-found nicetie you can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them, whereof I pray you let vs heare by the next. Laſtly, where you wiſh mee to
<hi>know that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer finally contemneth Hiſtoricall Faith cannot haue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two kinds of Faith, nor bee ſaued,</hi> I doe you to weet that I know it right well, but what you intend or would inferre thereon nor I nor I thinke your ſelfe know. Some thing was to be ſaid to make a ſhew and to fill vp paper: but what and how pertinent it is, <hi>Hippoclides</hi> cares not.</p>

<hi>Doe but restore my words, and your calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation will preſently vaniſh.</hi> All I ſay is no more but this that euery Saint of God both may and ought to haue particular aſſurance and perſwaſion: you report mee to ſay: A man may bee ſaued by this aſſurance, and that he ought to haue it as of neceſſity to ſaluation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which ſayings there are as the Poet ſpeaketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny high hils and deep ſeas: and therefore what iars or diſcords ſoeuer you haue here found, is in the ſong of your owne ſetting and not of my deuiſing. For what mad Syllogiſmes are theſe if inſteed of your imaginary propoſition you reſtore my true aſſertion, and then adde vnto it your Aſſumption and Concluſions, thus; <hi>A man may and ought to bee aſſured, But Aſſurance is not iuſtifying Faith,</hi> Ergo, <hi>a man may bee ſaued without a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith,</hi> Ergo, <hi>a man may bee ſaued by two kinds of Faith,</hi> Ergo, <hi>hee may bee ſaued, without that which hee ought of neceſsity to haue to ſaluation,</hi> Ergo, <hi>hee ought to haue that to ſaluation which will doe him no good to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Doe you not ſee that againſt the canons of Logick, firſt, you haue one tearme in the concluſion, namely may bee ſaued, which is not found in either of the premiſſes? Againe, that neither tearme of the Concluſion is in the Maior propoſition? And laſtly, that the Concluſion is affirmatiue notwithſtanding that the Aſſumption is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue? Fie, fie that a Logicke-wright ſhould ſo much ouerſhoot himſelfe, and ſo ſhamefully tranſgreſſe his owne precepts. This infamy (to retort vpon you your owne words) had you not incurred, if you could haue abſtained from peruerting my ſpeeches, and adding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſuch impudent gloſſems of your owne.</p>
                     <p>But yet when I ſay a man ought to haue Aſſurance,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10362:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> doe I not therein confeſſe it to bee ſo neceſſary vnto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation that a man cannot be ſaued without it? Nothing leſſe, and God forbid that euery ignorance or doubting of what wee ought to know, ſhould preſently exclude and barre vs from Saluation; for then no fleſh poſſibly could bee ſaued. Although therefore when I ſay a man may bee aſſured I confeſſe a poſſibility, and when I ſay hee ought to bee aſſured I acknowledge a dutie: yet doth it not follow thereupon that ſuch aſſurance is of abſolute neceſſity. Neceſſary it may bee vnto the well-being of the Sonne of God, but not vnto his Being, as if hee could not bee a new creature without it: neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cheere and ſolace him in the way to the end, but not vnto the end it ſelfe, as if without it hee could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire vnto ſaluation. Such abſolute neceſſity of aſſurance vpon paine of damnation I know none, ſaue onely of thoſe truths which wee call fundamentall, among which I ſuppoſe your and my iuſtification and ſaluation are not to bee reckoned. And yet had I ſaid (which I deny) that <hi>Aſſurance is neceſſary vnto Saluation,</hi> what inconuenience is it to ſay that neuertheleſſe it is not neceſſary vnto iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification? For Saluation is the End, Iuſtification a meane or way vnto the End, and more things are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vnto the end, then vnto the way: as vnto Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both Faith and workes are neceſſary, but vnto Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication Faith alone is required. And therefore alſo it is no abſurdity to ſay that two Faiths are requiſite vnto Saluation, as indeed Faith of Story and Faith of Perſon are, although but one Faith iuſtify which is Faith of Perſon. And thus much for your plaine-ſong: now let vs heare your deſcant and diuiſion vpon it.</p>

You ſay it is plaine becauſe <hi>whatſoeuer apprehendeth the laſt ſuch as is eternall life, apprehendeth the former alſo which is iuſtification.</hi> But firſt, what rule of Logicke allowes you thus to ſhift tearmes, and to turne bringing of life and iuſtification into apprehending life and iuſtification? For, howſoeuer you ſeeme to vſe them indifferently, yet are they words of different ſignifications: and therefore confounding them thus you make not ſo much the truth of the Maior plaine, as obſcure the meaning thereof. Againe, chuſe whether of theſe tearmes you pleaſe, yet is it palpably falſe that <hi>Whatſoeuer bringeth or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the laſt, bringeth and apprehendeth alſo the former.</hi> Rhetoricke brings a man to ſpeake eloquently which is the latter: yet it is Grammar not Rhetoricke that brings a man to ſpeake <hi>congruè</hi> which is the former. Phyſicke brings a man to the faculty of curing diſeaſes which is the latter: yet brings not to the knowledge of the nature of things; for that belongs vnto the naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and according to the old ſaying, where the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologer ends, there the Phyſician begins. So alſo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine matters, Hope apprehends eternall life which is the latter, for it is the proper obiect about which it is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: <pb n="88" facs="tcp:10362:53"/> it apprehendeth not iuſtification which is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for then by your rule it ſhould bee Faith it ſelfe, that being faith as you ſay which apprehends iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As therfore when diuerſe needles are by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone trained one after another, the vertue of the ſtone moueth the firſt, the firſt the ſecond, and ſo of the reſt, but the third or ſecond is no way the cauſe of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the firſt: ſo in the concatenation of the cauſes of our ſaluation reckoned vp by the Apoſtle, to wit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> Vocation, Iuſtification, Glorification, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are mouers as it were vnto the latter, but not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto the former. The reaſon of all in a word is this, becauſe as I haue already ſhewed, more is required vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the maine end, then vnto the ſubordinate meanes: and therefore ſeeing ſaluation is the end, Iuſtification the meanes, not whatſoeuer is requiſite vnto that is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary vnto this.</p>
                     <p>The Minor that <hi>true knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt bringeth eternall life,</hi> I alſo deny. For Particular aſſurance (which is the knowledge you muſt here vnderſtand, or elſe you conclude not to the purpoſe) bringeth not eternall life, in as much as a man may be ſaued without it, as we haue already ſufficiently proued.

And this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſaid to bee eternall life, not becauſe euery one that barely and nakedly knowes liues eternally (for as wee haue ſhewed Reprobates and Diuels haue Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb n="89" facs="tcp:10362:53"/> Faith) but partly, becauſe no man can liue without it, partly becauſe by it the Spirit of God worketh in the Elect that Faith by which they are iuſtified and ſo come to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>But what ſay I vnto the Minor deliuered in other tearmes, thus, <hi>Knowledge of Chriſt apprehendeth eternall life?</hi> I ſay firſt, it is not the ſame Propoſition, becauſe the tearmes are changed, neither are they equipollent. Secondly, I grant it to bee true, whether you meane by knowledge Dogmaticall Faith or Particular aſſurance: for by the one doe we apprehend that there is an eternall life, by the other that wee haue ſpeciall intereſt in it. Well then, if it apprehendeth eternall life doth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that therefore alſo it apprehendeth iuſtification? No, by no meanes: for as wee haue aboue demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is not neceſſary that that which apprehendeth the latter ſhould apprehend the former alſo. And yet though I diſallow the conſequence, the conſequent I readily yeeld you, that Particular knowledge apprehendeth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: for ſo haue wee defined <hi>Faith of promiſe to be a perſwaſion or aſsurance that the promiſe of God made in Chriſt, to wit iustification, remiſsion of ſinnes, adoption, regeneration, finally, election it ſelfe and eternall ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe particularly pertaine vnto mee and are mine.</hi> What gather you now of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay you, it is iuſtifying Faith. How ſo?
<hi>Becauſe whatſoeuer apprehendeth iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is iuſtifying Faith.</hi> Nay contrarily whatſoeuer apprehendeth iuſtification it not iuſtifying Faith: for apprehenſion followeth iuſtification, no man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to bee iuſtified vntill hee be iuſtified, but Iuſtifying Faith is in nature before iuſtification, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe and this the effect. And therefore vnleſſe <pb n="90" facs="tcp:10362:54"/> you will ſay that that which followeth is that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before, you cannot ſay that that which apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth iuſtification is that which iuſtifieth.</p>
                     <p>To conclude therefore neither is Faith knowledge nor knowledge Faith, but particular knowledge for ought you haue yet ſaid or can ſay commeth in time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith. But whereas finally you inferre that Faith is knowledge in the beginning, knowledge in proceeding, knowledge in the end, beſides that the foundation vpon which it is grounded is vntrue it is cleane contrary alſo to that which erewhile you affirmed, that <hi>Faith is but one, compounded of my three nice diſtinctions, the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning, the ſecond the progreſse, the third the end.</hi> For the third is Faith of Perſon, and in the Will, and is by your confeſſion there the end of Faith, yet here you ſay faith is knowledge in the end: which things how they can ſtand together I ſee not, vnleſſe you will ſay that knowledge is in the Will and ſo confound the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and operations of the ſoule.</p>

                     <p>To make all plaine, my argument reduced into the right forme ſtandeth thus, <hi>That which goeth before iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not that which followes after iuſtification: But Faith goeth before iuſtification and Aſsurance followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Faith is not Aſſurance.</hi> The Minor of this Syllogiſme is that which you deny affirming it to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe, and you confirme it to bee ſo by this reaſon, <hi>There may bee Aſſurance of Saluation in ſome meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be Performance of Faith Actuall in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meaſure,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Faith goeth not before Aſſurance, nor doth Aſsurance follow after Faith.</hi> The Antecedent of <pb n="96" facs="tcp:10362:57"/> which Enthymeme I grant, for as much as there may bee Aſſurance in this life, but not the performance of Faith actuall in the higheſt meaſure, wee here <hi>Belieuing only in part,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith. But if hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Therefore Faith goeth not before Aſsurance,</hi> it will alſo follow, <hi>Faith goeth not before Charity or good works,</hi> becauſe Charity and good works may be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, before Faith actuall bee in the higheſt meaſure: or thus, The elder Sonne is not borne before the yonger, becauſe the yonger may waxe as tall as a Pygmee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the elder bee growne to the ſtature of a Giant. Which Conſequences if they be abſurd and ridiculous, as abſurd and ridiculous is it to inferre that Faith cannot bee before Aſſurance, becauſe Aſſurance may bee in ſome meaſure before Faith bee in the higheſt meaſure. Nay farre better doth it follow from hence againſt your ſelfe that Faith is not Aſſurance, nor Aſſurance Faith. For if as you expreſly ſay Aſſurance may bee in a lower meaſure when Faith is in a higher, how can they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly differing ſo in degrees but bee differing things? For although it be true that <hi>more and leſſe doe not diuerſify the kind,</hi> yet is it as true that the ſame indiuiduall quality cannot at the ſame time bee both intended and remitted, no more then the ſame ſtring in a Lute can at once bee ſtrained vp, and let downe, and yeeld at the ſame time both a baſe and treble ſound.</p>

                     <p>The Minor which in the former ſection you denied,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10362:58"/> namely that Faith goes before iuſtification and Aſſurance followes after, in my Treatiſe I thus proued, becauſe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is promiſed vpon condition of Belieuing: and ſeeing in Conditionall promiſes there can bee no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the thing promiſed before the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Condition, therfore in this promiſe we muſt Belieue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be iuſtified, and be iuſtified before we can be aſſured we are iuſtified. Now to this you ſay it is rather an encouragement, then a Promiſe vpon condition: as if it were impoſſible that Promiſe vpon condition might bee an encouragement. Whereas me thinkes a Generall doth greatly encourage his Souldiers when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto them preferment and reward vpon condition of ſome peece of ſeruice well performed.<note place="margin">1 Cron. 11.6.</note> And <hi>Ioab</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture would not haue beene ſo forward and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the battell vnleſſe <hi>Dauid</hi> had promiſed the office of chiefe Captaine vpon condition of ſmiting the <hi>Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you haue reaſons for your ſaying more then a good many: for here like another <hi>Tertullian</hi> euery word almoſt you ſpeake is a Demonſtration. Firſt all the Church of God in all ages affirmeth with you: and yet as ſhall plentifully appeare in the next Section, the Church of God neuer vnderſtood but that Remiſſion of ſinnes was promiſed vpon condition of Faith. But as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras</hi> when hee was driuen to his ſhifts and could not finde out the reaſon of ſome things, was wont to ſay it was the doing of <hi>Nous:</hi> euen ſo when you haue boldly affirmed that which you can by no meanes proue, it is your manner deſperately to auouch that it is the ſaying of the Church. Secondly, you ſay this ſpeech, <hi>Belieue and thy ſinnes ſhall bee forgiuen thee</hi> is all one with this, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:10362:58"/> 
                        <hi>Thy ſinnes bee forgiuen thee, therefore bee of good comfort.</hi> Which happily wee may thinke not to be altogether ſo witleſſe, if alſo you can perſwade vs that a Phyſician ſaying vnto his Patient, <hi>Vſe carefully the courſe of Phiſicke I ſhall preſcribe vnto you, and you ſhall ſurely recouer of your ſickneſſe,</hi> meaneth thereby no other then as if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>Bee of good cheere, for thou art already reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of thy ſickneſse.</hi> Laſtly, by this meanes, you ſay both the former and the latter, to wit Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and Beliefe may bee aſcribed to the mercy of God. As if Promiſe of Remiſſion of ſinnes vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith were any way derogatory vnto the Mercy of God, but that both the one and the other may this notwithſtanding bee aſcribed thereunto. For if when God out of his ſoueraigne authority commaundeth to Belieue, it bee neuertheleſſe of his grace that wee can and doe Belieue, according to that of S. Auguſtin, <hi>Giue what thou commandest, and command what thou wilt:</hi> why when out of his mercy hee promiſeth Forgiueneſſe if we doe Belieue, ſhould it not bee aſcribed vnto the ſame his mercy that we doe performe the condition and Belieue?

The reaſon why it may thus be turned is, becauſe the Scribes vnderſtood Chriſt, as if hee himſelfe had actually forgiuen the Palſie-man his ſins, as appeareth in the ſixt and ſeuenth verſes, which they could not ſo haue conceiued if hee had onely told him that his ſinnes were forgiuen him. Now if this bee the right tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what ſay you to this argument.
<hi>The Palſie-man firſt belieued</hi> (for ſo it is ſaid) <hi>When Ieſus ſaw their Faith,</hi> meaning as well the Faith of the ſicke man as of them that brought him) <hi>and then after Chriſt forgaue his ſins,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Faith goes before Remiſſion: But Aſsurance, as wee haue ſhewed, followes after Remiſſion,</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not Faith.</hi> But you will follow the ordinary tranſlation. I giue you good leaue, for I take it to bee the trueſt: yet from thence alſo thus I argue, <hi>The Palſie man belieued, yet was not aſsured his ſinnes were forgiuen him till Chriſt told him ſo much,</hi> for otherwiſe what needed Chriſt to tell him what hee knew already, <hi>Ergo, Aſſurance is not Faith.</hi>

                     <speaker>Treatiſe.</speaker>
                     <p>That from whence followes a blaſphemous abſurditie cannot bee a truth, for from truth nought but truth can bee concluded: But from this, that Faith is Aſſurance ſuch an abſurditie doth follow. What is that? That God commands to Belieue an vntruth, and to bee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that which neuer ſhall bee. For God being truth cannot command falſhood to bee taken for truth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell mee here of who art thou that diſputeſt with God? For this is a ruled caſe in Diuinity, God cannot doe things which imply contradiction, and therefore not <pb n="106" facs="tcp:10362:62"/> make vntruth to bee truth, or knowledge errour. Now that this abſurdity followes from thence thus I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. God commands the Reprobate to belieue: for, for vnbeliefe the world ſhall bee condemned. But no condemnation but for breach of a commandement, for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and therefore they are commanded to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. I aske you then what it is to belieue? You will ſay, to know to bee aſſured. Therefore God commands the Reprobates to know and to bee aſſured. But this is a blaſphemous abſurdity, therefore is your opinion ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd which infers it.</p>

But that <hi>God ſhould commaund a Reprobate to belieue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth if hee command him to belieue and hee ſhall bee ſaued,</hi> I neuer yet affirmed. What then? This that, <hi>He ſhould command him to belieue an vntruth, if hee command him, to belieue that hee is iuſtified and ſhall bee ſaued.</hi> A ſmall <pb n="107" facs="tcp:10362:62"/> difference will you ſay betweene And, and That. So was there betwixt
<hi>Shibboleth</hi> and <hi>Sibboleth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iude.

For this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Belieue and thou ſhalt bee ſaued</hi> is Hypotheticall and Conditionall, as if it were ſaid in other tearmes, <hi>If thou belieue thou ſhalt bee ſaued:</hi> But this, <hi>Belieue and aſſure thy ſelfe that thou ſhalt bee ſaued</hi> is Categoricall and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute excluding all Condition. Now that God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all both Elect and Reprobate to Belieue in the Lord Ieſus, and promiſes vnto them Iuſtification and Saluation conditionally if they Belieue, I grant: but that hee commands the Reprobate abſolutely to know and aſſure himſelfe, that hee is already iuſtified, and ſhall hereafter bee ſaued and glorified, I conſtantly deny. Which yet your opinion that Faith is an Aſſurance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infers, and therefore cannot bee true.

                     <p>No, <hi>Maſter Baxter,</hi> it is not for duſt and aſhes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Creator of all things: nor for baſe clay to enter diſputation with ſo glorious a Maieſtie. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that eternall truth ſpeaketh, I reuerence and adore, and dare not preſume to ſearch a higher reaſon of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then his will, knowing full well that his will is the prime rule and cauſe of Iuſtice, and therefore that it is both folly to ſeeke a former then the firſt, and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſubiect Gods will vnto ſome extrinſecall director. But yet with you who (as I take it) are made of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moulds then my ſelfe, and are not exempted from thoſe humane infirmities, whereunto the reſt of your brethren are ſubiect, I hope I may bee bold to enter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and to hold diſputation, as in other matters, ſo touching this preſent queſtion alſo. To you therefore this I ſay that, <hi>God doth indeed command the reprobate to belieue vnto ſaluation,</hi> and yet neuer ſhall he belieue nor bee ſaued. The cauſe hereof I know to bee Gods will, and am content with all lowlineſſe and humility to ſay with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.26.</note> 
                        <hi>Euen ſo O Father becauſe thy good pleaſure was ſuch.</hi> But what is this to our purpoſe? For it is one thing to <hi>command a Reprobate to belieue the Goſpell,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to <hi>command him to know and aſſure himſelfe that hee is already iuſtified and ſhall bee ſaued:</hi> for to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Goſpell is to aſſent vnto an infallible truth, but to bee perſwaded of the other is to yeeld to that which neither is nor euer ſhall bee true. You ſhould therefore <pb n="109" facs="tcp:10362:63"/> euidently demonſtrate out of the Scriptures that God commands a Reprobate ſo to bee aſſured and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and then if I reſted not ſatisfied with Gods reuealed will, you might iuſtly bid mee <hi>goe and diſpute with Christ,</hi> and forbid to <hi>ſearch into the counſels of God leſt I be ouerwhelmed with his Maiesty.</hi> But if in Gods booke you cannot ſhew it, I hold it a humane fancy rather then a diuine truth: and therefore though I may not curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prie into the ſecrets of God, yet may I freely trie and examine the ground of mens opinions.</p>

                        <hi>Againe it is an vntruth that God commandeth, when he biddeth a Reprobate to belieue and hee ſhall bee ſaued. For, if hee could belieue, he ſhould then be ſaued without doubt,</hi> Ioh. 11. <hi>That hee cannot belieue, the reaſon is, Chriſt hath not waſhed him</hi> Io. 13.8.
<hi>neither hath opened his heart to belieue. So that if hee could haue belieued, hee ſhould haue this doctrine effectuall vnto him to ſaluation. That he therefore could not belieue is not to bee imputed to the falſity of the doctrine, but to the hardneſſe of his owne heart.</hi>

                     <p>The commandement of God is abſolute, Belieue: the promiſe of Saluation is conditionall, if we Belieue, That the Promiſe is conditionall you denyed in your anſwer to the former argument: now alſo you deny that Belieuing is commanded. Whereby you bewray, <hi>how inexpert you are in the Word of righteouſneſſe,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh: and that whereas by office you are,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12 13.</note> and

                        <hi>concerning the time ought to be a teacher, yet haue you need your ſelfe to be taught the very elements of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> That therefore the Promiſe is conditionall I haue in the due place demonſtrated: now that Belieuing is commanded remaineth to bee poued, or rather it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proued, thus, <hi>No condemnation but for breach of a Commandement, Condemnation for vnbeliefe: for, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe the world ſhall bee condemned,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Beliefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi> But this reaſon according to your wont you cunningly ſuppreſſe, and hauing found out a new Art of diſputation, thinke it enough to ſcorne the premiſſes, and with a bold face to deny the Concluſion.

A man would wonder how you could ſo ſoone forget your ſelfe, but that it is commonly ſeene a liar hath ſeldome or neuer a good memory.</p>
                     <p>But to proue that God commands not a Reprobate to belieue you come vpon mee with a moſt mighty and inſoluble Enthymem. What is that I beſeech you? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this. <hi>A Reprobate if he could belieue, he ſhould then without doubt bee ſaued:</hi> Ergo, <hi>God doth not command him to Belieue.</hi> A deſperate Demonſtration I promiſe you: for by the ſame reaſon you may conclude, that God commands him not to obey the Precepts of the Morall law neither, Becauſe if hee could keepe them he ſhould bee ſaued. What you conceiue may bee the knot and ſowlder as it were of this Conſequence I cannot well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, vnleſſe it be one of two, either this, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the Reprobate hee ſhall bee ſaued if hee Belieue,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> hee commandeth him not to Belieue: or this, The Reprobate cannot belieue, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him not to Belieue, for your words ſeeme to bee indifferent either way. If you intend the former, firſt, you contradict your owne ſelfe, for in your anſwer to the former argument you deny Iuſtification and Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="112" facs="tcp:10362:65"/> to bee promiſed vpon condition of Faith. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euery <hi>Catechumenus</hi> and Nouice in Diuinity knowes that God vnto Commandement vſually annexeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to draw on Obedience: as in the Couenant of works, firſt hee Commandeth, Doe this and then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, if thou doe it thou ſhalt liue; and in the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace alſo, firſt hee Commandeth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and then addeth the Promiſe, if thou belieue thou ſhalt bee ſaued. So that Promiſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement exclude not one the other, neither doth it follow, Faith is the condition of a Promiſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not commanded. If you vnderſtand the latter, then know that as <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and
<hi>Barnard,</hi> and all Diuines not infected with Pelagianiſme ſay, God commandeth ſome things which man cannot doe, to the end that knowing his owne inſufficiency, hee may craue of him the helpe of grace that hee may doe them. And if God doe command any ſupernaturall action vnto the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate as without doubt hee doth, then doth hee alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome thing aboue his power: for being meerely naturall he cannot produce any ſupernaturall operation. Whereupon it followeth euidently that although a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate cannot belieue, yet neuertheleſſe hee may bee commanded to Belieue.</p>
                     <p>Well, yet you will proue that a Reprobate cannot Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. To what end? for it is not denied, and you ſhould rather ſtrengthen your Conſequence, and proue that therefore Faith is not commanded. Notwithſtanding let vs heare your reaſon, for it ſeemeth to bee very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. <hi>That hee cannot Belieue,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the reaſon is, Chriſt hath not waſhed him.</hi> If you had ſaid as followeth, Chriſt hath not opened his heart to Belieue, or, it is to <pb n="113" facs="tcp:10362:65"/> bee imputed to the hardnes of his owne heart, and had ſtopt there, I ſhould eaſily haue yeelded vnto you: but now that you ſay the <hi>reaſon is becauſe Chriſt hath not waſhed him,</hi> I muſt needs tell you it is vnreaſonable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for it implies that wee are firſt waſhed and then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, whereas both Scripture and the analogie of Faith teach vs that we firſt belieue and then afterward are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Search the booke of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28. Act. 15.9. Rom. 3.25.</note> and there ſhall you read, that wee are iuſtified by Faith, that the heart is purified by Faith, that God hath ſet forth Ieſus Chriſt to bee a reconciliation through Faith in his Blood. Which Blood although it haue in it ſufficient vertue and force to cleanſe vs from the leproſie of all our ſinnes, yet doth it not actually waſh or purge any vnleſſe it bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applied and accepted by Faith. Otherwiſe, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> excellently ſpeaketh,
<hi>if thou belieue not, Chriſt deſcended not for thee, Chriſt ſuffered not for thee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De fide ad Gratian.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it manifeſtly appeareth that Remiſſion of ſinnes is an effect or conſequence of Faith, and that therefore the reaſon of the Reprobates vnbeliefe, is not becauſe Chriſt hath not waſht him, but rather the reaſon why Chriſt hath not waſhed him is, becauſe hee doth not belieue, nor hath by Faith applyed the blood of Chriſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the remiſſion of his ſinnes. Where you adde negatiuely, that the Reprobates vnbeliefe, is not to bee imputed to the falſity of the Doctrine, whether you meane thereby either this Doctrine that <hi>God commands him to belieue,</hi> or this that <hi>it is abſurd hee ſhould command him to bee aſsured,</hi> I confeſſe indeed, that neither is the cauſe why the Reprobate cannot belieue: but that either of them is falſe, you ſhall neuer bee able to ſhew, and I haue ſufficiently proued the contrary.</p>

Theſe two Propoſitions are contradictory, The Reprobate is iuſtified, The Reprobate is not iuſtified: and, The Reprobate ſhall bee ſaued, The Reprobate ſhall not bee ſaued.

                        <hi>Whoſoeuer ſaith, if God bee omnipotent, let him make that thoſe things which haue been haue not been, ſees not that he faith, if God be omnipotent, let him make that thoſe things which are true in that they are true be falſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. One part of the Contradiction is neceſſarily falſe namely this, The Reprobate is iuſtified,<note place="margin">Rom.
8.30.</note> The Reprobate ſhall bee ſaued: for they onely who are Predeſtinated vnto life, are as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, effectually called, and they onely who are effectually called are iuſtified and ſhall bee glorified. And if it were poſſible that they ſhould bee ſaued, then were there change in the vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable decree of God which hath finally reiected them, which is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Hee that commands a Reprobate that is not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſhall neuer bee ſaued, to belieue that hee is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſhall be ſaued, implieth a Contradiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:10362:68"/> and makes Falſhood to bee Truth, and Faith errour. For according to that infallible maxime, <hi>Falſhood is not vnder Faith:</hi> and therefore if the Obiect bee Falſhood it is not Faith which apprehendeth it for true, if it bee Faith Falſhood is not the Obiect thereof. So that hee which commands that falſe Propoſition to bee belieued, makes that to bee Faith which cannot beare the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, and that to bee the Obiect which is not the Obiect thereof, that is as I ſaid makes Faith to bee error, and Falſhood Truth, which are contradictories.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. God therefore neither doth nor can ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: neither is it impure or impious to affirme ſo much, being in the Word of God ſo manifeſtly reuealed.

For firſt I proue vnto you that Faith cannot be a full Perſwaſion &amp; certaine Aſſurance, partly becauſe it is not ſo much as Aſſurance, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Fulnes agrees not to little Faith, and ſo makes the definition narrower and of leſſe latitude then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and partly becauſe it is a moſt diſcomfortable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to weake Chriſtians, who finding this ſtrength of Aſſurance wanting in themſelues, may doubt whether they haue any Faith at all, if Faith bee no other then a full Aſſurance and firme reſolution. Againe, I anſwer certaine obiections the chiefeſt you can haue againſt mee, and that with ſuch generall ſolutions as will cut off almoſt any reaſon you can oppoſe vnto mee. Theſe things being of ſuch importance and conſequence ſhould not thus haue beene balked and huſht vp in ſilence: for while they ſtand vnſtirred and vntoucht you cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably bee thought either fully to haue ſatisfied my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or ſufficiently to haue maintained your owne cauſe.

Receiuing is a word of Relation and anſwereth vnto Offering: for what is not offered is rather taken then receiued. To offer Chriſt vnto any is the Act of God onely: to receiue Chriſt, is the Act onely of the Elect of God. God offereth Chriſt vnto vs, when either outwardly by the publike preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, or inwardly by the ſecret knocking of his ſpirit, he counſelleth and aduiſeth vs to acknowledge that Ieſus is the Mediator, and to admit of him for our Mediator.

Beſides therefore this Receiuing of Chriſt by the Vnderſtanding, there is a Receiuing of him alſo by the Will, which is done by particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when in the ſincerity of our hearts we accept and make choice of him alone to bee our Mediator, that is to ſay, to bee vnto vs a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King. Wee accept him to bee our Prophet, when wee admit him to be our teacher, and abſolutely ſubmit our ſelues vnto his teaching. Wee accept him to bee our Prieſt, <pb n="134" facs="tcp:10362:76"/> when wee reſt and repoſe our ſelues vpon his Sacrifice and interceſſion for the waſhing away of our ſinnes. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, wee accept him to bee our King, when wee put our ſelues wholly and onely vnder his gouernment, and ſubiect our wils vnto his will, deſiring that in all things it alone may bee done by vs. And this accepting of Chriſt by the Will, is that very Receiuing of him which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> here meaneth.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note> For firſt, whoſoeuer thus accepteth of him hath without queſtion withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him the ſame power and prerogatiue, which hee affirmeth to bee giuen to as many as receiue him, namely to bee made the Sonnes of God. Againe, that Receiuing is vnderſtood which is oppoſed vnto the Iewes nor Receiuing:<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.11.</note> for hauing ſaid, <hi>He came vnto his owne,</hi> that is vnto the Iewes, <hi>and his owne receiued him not,</hi> immediatly it is added, <hi>But as many as receiued him, &amp;c.</hi> How then did the Iewes not receiue him? onely in not aſſenting vnto this that hee was the Meſſias? Indeed this was the ground why ſundry of them receiued him not: but their not-receiuing of him was no other then that Act of their Will, whereby they refuſed to ſubmit themſelues vnto him as vnto the Meſſias. This doth our Sauiour intimate,<note place="margin">Ioh.

Theſe then knowing him to bee the Meſſias, and yet not receiuing him, what can this not-receiuing be other then their will full reiecting and refuſing of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their knowledge and againſt their conſcience. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all which it followeth that this being not-receiuing, receiuing oppoſed thereunto muſt needs bee that Act of the Will whereby wee accept of Chriſt to bee our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, that is to ſay, our Prophet to inſtruct vs, our Prieſt to make atonement for vs, our King to rule and gouerne vs. And becauſe Belieuing and Receiuing are (as we haue ſhewed) all one, it followeth alſo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that to Belieue in Chriſt is nothing elſe then ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him.</p>
                     <p>To grow therefore at length vnto an iſſue, you ſee that according to promiſe I haue demonſtrated vnto you, firſt, that thoſe tearmes both of the old and new Teſtament mentioned in my Treatiſe import that Act of Faith whereby wee ſtand iuſtified before God: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is the true, proper, and naturall meaning and ſignification of theſe tearmes: and that therefore thirdly by the word Reſt, in my Definition I vnderſtand no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then that which theſe words import and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify. Wherefore I muſt intreate you in the reſidue of your Reply to ſpeake vnto this meaning: otherwiſe you ſhall but ſpend your breath in vaine, and wreſtle not with mee, but with your owne ſhadow. Neuertheleſſe if <pb n="136" facs="tcp:10362:77"/> any ſhall thinke it fitter inſteed of the word Reſt, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any other of theſe tearmes, I forbid him not: for ſo doing he ſhall differ from mee in word onely, and not in ſenſe. And to ſpeake ingenuouſly and freely, ſeeing to expreſſe the Act of Faith ſpeciall choice is made in the New Teſtament of Belieuing in, or vpon, and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is expounded by ſuch Receiujng as is before deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed: happily it were not amiſſe aboue all the reſt to preferre this, and to define Faith by that <hi>Act of the Will whereby wee accept Chriſt to bee our Mediator for iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and conſequently Saluation.</hi> The rather becauſe it ſeemes more fully and plainely to ſet forth the nature of that Act by which wee are iuſtified, and more apt and fit to reſolue many doubts which may be moued touching iuſtification.

                     <p>Here, <hi>Master Baxter,</hi> and in the reſt of your anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers <pb n="137" facs="tcp:10362:77"/> inſuing, you waue &amp; flote vp and downe like a boat in a ſtorme without a Pilote, anſwering tumultuarily what euer comes next to head, and ſcorning like another <hi>Caſſius Seuerus</hi> to keep either in method your matter,<note place="margin">Tacit. vel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs Quintil. de cauſſ. cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. eloq.</note> or modeſtie in your words. But as you lead the dance, ſo muſt I needs follow. Thus therefore you argue.
<hi>No man can be damned hauing iuſtifying Faith, A man may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reſting his will vpon Chriſt &amp; his merits,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Reſting of the will vpon Chriſt and his merits is not iuſtifying Faith:</hi> The Maior I grant, the Minor thus you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>Hee that wanteth ſanctification may bee damned, A man reſting his will vpon Chriſt and his merits may want ſanctification,</hi> Ergo, <hi>a man reſting his will vpon Chriſt and his merits may be damned.</hi> The Maior againe I grant, if you vnderſtand it either thus, <hi>Hee that finally wanteth ſanctification ſhall bee damned,</hi> or thus, <hi>Hee that wanteth preſent ſanctification is for the preſent in the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi> for otherwiſe the Elect vntill their effectuall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation want ſanctification, and yet ſhall neuer actually be damned. The Minor you barely affirme but confirme not: thinking it as it ſeemes proofe inough if you ſay it and ſubſcribe thereunto Witneſſe our ſelfe: vnto this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument therefore I anſwer two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that you are a very vnkind and vngratefull man that hauing now the third or fourth time borowed argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of me to ſerue your need, haue not the good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſay mee God a mercy for it, or to acknowledge to whom you haue beene beholding. For in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thus I obiected againſt my ſelfe, <hi>If Faith be Affiance then the wicked may haue it: for Balaam deſired to die the death of the Righteous, and ſome receiue the Word with ioy belieuing for a time.</hi> And vnto this obiection in the ſame <pb n="138" facs="tcp:10362:78"/> Treatiſe I gaue a ſufficient and full ſolution, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betweene that Affiance which is ſleight and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and that which is ſetled and grounded, as there you may read more at large, for thither I referre you. But becauſe,<note place="margin">Hecub. act. 2.</note> as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith, the ſame ſpeech ſpoken by diuerſe perſons is not alike entertained: peraduenture this anſwer would be better accepted if you might haue it from the mouth of greater authority. Read then <hi>M. Perkins</hi> expoſition of the Creed, whereupon the firſt word I Belieue hee intreats of the nature of Faith, and you ſhall find in effect the ſame obiection in like manner anſwered, and diſtinction made betweene the <hi>fleeting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; deſires</hi> of them who liue ſtill in their ſins &amp; after the courſe of the world &amp; the <hi>Deſire of reconciliation</hi> that comes from a bruzed heart, &amp; brings with it alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; amendment of life. This ſolution howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer now you haue cunningly diſſembled, yet I muſt pray you the next time not to ouerſlip it: for otherwiſe you ſhall bee counted but a miching diſputer, and no whit at all diſaduantage your aduerſary, fighting againſt him with no better weapon then a ruſty ſword both edge and point rebated.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I anſwer vnto your Minor negatiuely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that ſuch <hi>Reſting of the will vpon Chriſt and his merits,</hi> as wee haue deſcribed, and in the definition vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, can at any time bee ſeparated from Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For beſides that it is contrary vnto your owne Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as anon in the due place ſhall bee obſerued: it is alſo flatly repugnant vnto the rules of holy Scripture. For doth not the Scripture pronounce them all, <hi>Bleſſed, that retire themſelues vnto the Lord?</hi>

Nay, whoſoeuer <hi>accepteth Ieſus Chriſt for his Mediator,</hi> ſubmitteth himſelfe as wee haue ſhewed not onely vnto his Prophecy and Prieſthood, but alſo vnto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and if hee ſubmit himſelfe vnto his Kingdome, that is vnto his rule and gouernment, how can hee bee Vnſanctified? for the Vnſanctified man ſubiecteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto the Fleſh, and not vnto the Spirit of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Act.
15.9.</note> where by the way you may obſerue, defining Faith in this ſort, how and after what manner it purifieth the heart, and begetteth in vs ſanctity and newneſſe of life: whereas defining it by Aſſurance as you doe, it doth not readily appeare how ſuch Aſſurance can bee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and reaſon of our Sanctification. True it is that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance may bee vnto vs a ſtrong motiue to proceed on in Sanctification and holyneſſe of life: but it is ſo farre from cauſing it, that it is rather cauſed by it. For by our holy life and conuerſation as by the fruites, doe wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily gather that Faith which is the cauſe thereof is <pb n="140" facs="tcp:10362:79"/> in vs, and ſo grow to an Aſſurance of our Iuſtification and preſent ſtate in grace.

On the other ſide if you define Faith with mee to bee that Act whereby wee accept and make choice of Chriſt to bee our Mediator, that is to ſay, our Prophet, Prieſt, and King: who ſeeth not that this Faith working in vs a free and voluntary ſubiection vnto the Kingdom of Chriſt, is the very purifier of our hearts, and the cauſe of all our holy ſtudies and indeuours? whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it appeareth what the reaſon is why our Sauiour vnto belieuing in the Sonne oppoſeth Diſobedience vnto him when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.36.</note>

If I had thought it fitting to haue troubled the Definition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I was not ſo ignorant but I could haue called it either an infuſed grace, or a gratious habit, or a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall vertue: but becauſe the Philoſopher taught me that Habits are ſufficiently defined by their Acts in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto their proper Obiects, I held it needleſſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it.</p>

But if you would thereby perſwade that Reſt or Affiance is not the Act of Faith, I muſt tell you that theſe reaſons are cleane out of date, and that you doe too much abuſe your Readers patience ſetting againe before him theſe Coleworts now more then twice ſodden.

<hi>which is ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Aſsurance may bee the Act of Faith.</hi> If you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the latter, then doe I grant the Maior: for if ſuch Aſſurance be (as I haue demonſtratiuely proued) it ſelfe the Effect of Faith, it is more then manifeſt that, <hi>That which is an effect of ſuch Aſſurance cannot bee the Act of Faith.</hi> But then I deny the Minor, that
<hi>Reſting vpon Christ, is an effect of ſuch aſſurance:</hi> affirming that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily <pb n="145" facs="tcp:10362:81"/> Reſting vpon Chriſt is the cauſe of ſuch Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Aſſurance is the Effect of that Reſting.</p>
                     <p>But, what reſt, ſay you, can a man haue vpon Chriſt, without Aſſurance to be ſaued by his Death &amp; Paſſion? Surely vnleſſe wee know his Death and Paſſion to bee the onely meanes of ſaluation, wee cannot reſt vpon him for it: but to ſay, that a man cannot reſt vpon him for ſaluation, vnleſſe hee know that hee is already tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life, is a moſt vnreaſonable and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſpeech, as if a man might not truſt vnto his friend to doe ſomething for him, vntill he were ſure, it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done. If you be ſo ſandblind in this preſent caſe that you cannot ſee how Reſt may goe before Aſſurance, yet I hope your ſight is not ſo much decayed but you may perceiue it through a paire of ſpectacles. Put caſe then that a skilfull and welknowne Phyſician ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer freely to cure the diſeaſes of ſuch as are ſicke vpon condition they receiue Phyſicke of no other, but put themſelues wholly &amp; abſolutely into his hands: doe you thinke it abſurd to become his patient, or that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repoſe your ſelfe vpon his skill to bee cured by him, vnleſſe you be firſt aſſured that the cure is already done? Nay rather if you know well, that your health is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly recouered, you cannot rely vpon him, for that whereof you are fully poſſeſſed. Ieſus Chriſt the Arch-phyſician of our ſoules, as hee is knowne to bee all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and euery way able to heale our maladies, ſo doth hee louingly inuite all thoſe that are heauy loden to come vnto him, promiſing to refreſh them all vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that renouncing themſelues and all others they ſet their whole Affiance on him for the remiſſion of their ſinnes. And dare you now make queſtion how a man <pb n="146" facs="tcp:10362:82"/> may betake himſelfe into the hands of Chriſt, vntill he know that his ſinnes bee already pardoned? Nay rather when wee know the debt is paid, and that according to the old rule <hi>ſinnes once remitted neuer returne againe,</hi> we remaine thankefull for that which is paſt, and continue our Affiance on him for diſcharge of that which is to come. For (to obſerue this by the way) wee may not thinke that in the firſt act of our conuerſion and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we receiue actuall pardon of all our ſinnes paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come, as ſome, and thoſe of no meane marke haue raſhly and vnaduiſedly taught: for ſinnes paſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are then actually forgiuen, and ſinnes to come onely in the deſtination and purpoſe of God. But neither doth God actually pardon the iuſtified man, nor the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man actually receiue pardon for his ſinnes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee haue actually committed them, and renewed his Faith and Repentance for them. Neither let any man thinke that I ſpeake this out of mine owne head, and without ground: for I am ſtrongly backed herein by the warrant of Scripture, the euidence of reaſon, and the teſtimony of worthy men.

                     <p>Thus you reaſon, Faith is a labour, Reſt is not a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is not a Reſt. The Maior you proue thus, That which worketh reſt is a labour, But Faith worketh reſt and ceaſeth when reſt is wrought, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Faith is a labour. The Minor you leaue naked and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe, ſuppoſing I thinke that no man vnleſſe bereft of his fiue wits would deny it, and hold that Reſt is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Let vs therefore briefly examine them both. The Maior of your ſecond Syllogiſme preciſely and literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood is not true: for that which worketh is the Agent or Labourer, and the Labourer cannot bee the Action or Labour. Whereupon it followeth, If that which worketh bee not a labour, And Faith as you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume worke, that therefore Faith is not a labor which is contradictory vnto the Maior of your firſt Syllogyſme. And yet as I grant not vnto you that Faith is a labour, ſo neither dare I peremptorily deny it: only I blame you for ſpeaking ſo confuſedly where it was neceſſary to vſe diſtinction. Know therefore that Faith as all other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities whether acquired or infuſed may bee conſidered two wayes, either in the firſt act, (as Schooles vſe to ſpeake) or in the ſecond. The firſt act is the very habit of Faith inhering and ſticking in the ſoule: the ſecond is the immediate and proper operation and action thereof. If then you vnderſtand Faith in the firſt Act, and as it is an Habit, it is not a labour, but is imprinted in vs by the Holy Ghoſt, to the end that when oportunity is offered, and duty requireth, wee may by vertue thereof more ſweetly, readily, and eaſily worke, and labour. And ſo <pb n="149" facs="tcp:10362:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> far is it from being a labor it ſelfe, that oftentimes it lieth as it were idle &amp; aſleep doing nothing at all vntill it pleaſe the Spirit of God to ſtirre vp our wils, and to quicken the ſparke hee hath put in vs, inabling vs thereby to coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him. But if you vnderſtand Faith in the ſecond Act, and as it is in operation and action, then may you iuſtly call it a labour: for as our Sauiour ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.29.</note> to belieue in him whom the Father hath ſent is a Worke which God requireth vs to doe, in regard whereof the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the Worke of Faith.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.3.</note> And becauſe Faith iuſtifieth, not as it is in the firſt, but in the ſecond act, that is not as it is an Habit, but as it is in action, accepting and applying vnto vs Chriſt and his merits, hence is it, ſaith <hi>Bucer,</hi> that Proteſtants vſually define it by a motion.<note place="margin">De iuſtific.</note> Let the Maior therefore in this ſenſe bee granted vnto you.</p>
                     <p>The Minor which you thinke to bee ſo cockſure I flatly deny, confidently affirming that Reſt is a labour: prouided, you vnderſtand no other Reſt then that which in my Treatiſe I haue expreſſed and declared. For if by Reſt you meane Quiet, ſuch Reſt without all queſtion is not Labour: for it is the end of labour, and a ceſſation from it, and therefore well did you ſay that, <hi>when eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſt is wrought, then the labour of Faith ceaſeth.</hi> But you cannot bee ignorant, that by Reſt I vnderſtand not Quiet, but Affiance, in as much as I render the Latin word <hi>Fiducia</hi> by it, and make the Act thereof to bee
<hi>Inniti,</hi> which (as I haue ſhewed in ſome of our Engliſh tranſlations) is oftentimes turned by Reſting and Staying vpon. And this Reſt, that is, this Relying, this Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, this Truſting or Belieuing on Chriſt, is not a Quiet, but a motion or operation, and therefore a labour. True it is that whoſoeuer commeth vnto Chriſt, and ſetteth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10362:84"/> his whole Affiance vpon him, ſhall thereby finde refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Quiet vnto his ſoule: yet neuertheleſſe it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that Affiance it ſelfe, is an act or motion of the Will, and not a Quiet, euen as the inclination of a mans ſelfe vpon his ſtaffe, or the laying of him downe vpon his bed is an action of the body. In a word remember what a little before I haue deliuered to cleare this tearme from all ambiguity, and take it in the ſame ſenſe which there I giue vnto it, and vnleſſe you will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that light is darkneſſe you cannot but confeſſe that ſuch reſt is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſo that notwithſtanding this argument, Faith may be a Reſt.</p>
                     <p>But now giue mee leaue to take vp the weapon which you are forced to lay downe, and to trie whether a blow therewith from my arme will pearce any deeper: for thus I retort your owne reaſon againſt you.
<hi>Faith is rather a labour then a reſt, Aſſurance is not ſo, but rather a reſt then a labour,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Faith is not Aſsurance.</hi> The Maior is your owne, and you may not deny it. The Minor I proue thus,
<hi>Intellection or knowledge,</hi> ſaith Ariſtotle, <hi>is more like vnto reſt and quiet then vnto motion:</hi> for although the mind while it is inquiring &amp; ſeeking for knowledge is euer in motion and ſo laboureth, yet when the Habit of knowledge is once acquired and gotten, then is there no farther motion of the vnderſtanding thereunto, but a ſweet reſt and Quiet therein. Whereupon ſaith the ſame Philoſopher, <hi>By the quieting &amp; ſetling of the ſoule, doth a man become intelligent and wiſe,</hi> meaning by Quiet, as <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> expoundeth him,<note place="margin">Exerc. in Card. 307. 13.</note> nothing elſe but the aſſent of the minde. I aſſume, <hi>But Aſſurance is ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection or knowledge,</hi> for it is an <hi>habituall aſſent</hi> vnto this truth, that wee are in the preſent ſtate of grace and <pb n="151" facs="tcp:10362:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhall infallibly bee ſaued. Wherefore I conclude that <hi>Aſsurance is rather a reſt or quiet then a labour:</hi> whence alſo it farther followeth that <hi>Faith,</hi> being as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe <hi>rather a labour, then a reſt,</hi> cannot be <hi>Aſsurance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, Faith, you ſay, ceaſeth when eternall pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and reſt is wrought. I grant: for the Obiect of Faith, as the Apoſtle ſaith, are things which are not ſeene, whereupon Saint
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> elegantly,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Si vides non eſt Fides,</hi> Beholding is not Belieuing. As therefore while we liue here in theſe earthly tabernacles, and are abſent from the Lord, <hi>wee walke not by Sight, but by Faith:</hi> ſo when wee ſhall be clothed vpon,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.4.7. Verſ. 4.</note> and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhall bee ſwallowed vp of life, then ſhall <hi>wee walke not by Faith, but by Sight.</hi> Neither is the ceaſing of Faith any loſſe or diſaduantage, but an exchange for the better, namely viſion: for Seeing vnto Belieuing is, as the full brightneſſe of the Sunne is to the glimmering light of a candle. I aſſume then, <hi>But Aſsurance ceaſeth not when eternall pacification and rest is wrought:</hi> for then the certainty of our Election, of our adoption, of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation into grace, and finally of our Saluation is ſo farre from ceaſing, that it is by ſo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto vs, as intuitiue apprehenſion and the ſight of the eye is more infallible then heare-ſay or ſeeing by reflexion. I conclude therefore out of your owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>Faith ceaſing, and Aſsurance not ceaſing, Faith is not Aſsurance.</hi> But as touching Affiance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpon the mediation of Chriſt for iuſtification and Saluation, it is euident that that ceaſeth when wee ſhall haue obtained eternall reſt and pacification. For being perfectly quitted of our ſinnes, and in full poſſeſſion of Saluation, how can wee farther ſet out Affiance vpon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10362:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> him for it? Eſpecially ſeeing hee ſhall then ceaſe to bee vnto vs a Mediator of Redemption and Reconciliation, in regard whereof only hee is the Obiect of Affiance or Iuſtifying Faith, and ſhall bee vnto vs no otherwiſe then he is vnto the Elect Angels, a Mediatour of Conſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confirme &amp; preſerue vs eternally in the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate of glory. For neither ſhall hee Prophecy any more vnto vs by the miniſtry of the Goſpell, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate for vs by the ſacrifice of his death and Paſſion, nor gouerne vs by the ſcepter of his word as here hee doth:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> but in this reſpect ſhall hee <hi>deliuer vp the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto his Father,</hi> and the Godhead in the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhall without all meanes bee immediately vnto vs all in all.</p>

That <hi>a full aſsurance as a cauſe worketh reſt vpon Chriſt as an effect.</hi> But neither is Aſſurance Faith, and I haue ſufficiently proued that Aſſurance is not the cauſe of Reſt, nor Reſt an effect of Aſſurance.

<hi>Faith worketh eternall reſt and peace.</hi> But how doth this follow, Faith is the cauſe of eternall quiet and reſting from our labours in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is the cauſe of Affiance and Reſting vpon Chriſt here in this life? for it is not neceſſary that that which cauſeth the one, ſhould alſo cauſe the other.

The reaſon of all in a word is, becauſe this forme of words may import that Affiance is the next and immediate Act of Iuſtifying Faith.

                     <p>That the word Reſt is ambiguous I ſaw well inough, and therefore in my Treatiſe carefully diſtinguiſhed the equiuocation thereof, where if you marked it not, you muſt blame your owne ouerſight and not my Vnwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For two kinds of <hi>Reſting vpon Christ,</hi> I ſaid there were, the one <hi>Sleight</hi> and <hi>Superficiall,</hi> the other <hi>Setled and well grounded,</hi> and this <hi>Setled and grounded Affiance</hi> I made to bee the <hi>Act of Iustifying Faith,</hi> as there you may read more at large.

<hi>the Body of a man is not a ſolid ſubſtance.</hi> And thus, to requite you with your owne Prouerbe, you periſh like the rat by bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelfe: for hauing vrged this argument now twice againſt mee and that with ſuch confidence as if it alone were ſufficient to batter downe the bulwarke of my Definition, at length you tell ys very grauely and ſadly that it is but paper ſhot which hitherto you haue diſcharged, and that all the breaches you haue made may eaſily bee repaired by diſtinguiſhing an equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Where you ſay <hi>I take vpon mee to ſee more then euer any learned man ſaw before my time,</hi> it hath beene already ſufficiently anſwered both in my Treatiſe &amp; in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof. Neuertheleſſe becauſe you harpe ſo often vpon this ſtring, this I adde, that (vnleſſe you can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that it is impoſſible for a man of meane parts, and gifts to ſee and obſerue that which men of greater lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and deeper vnderſtanding haue not obſerued) I know no reaſon why a man may not without taxation of modeſty take vpon him in ſome things to ſee that which others haue not ſeene before him. It is true that a Giant by reaſon of his tallneſſe muſt needs ſee farther then a dwarfe or one that is but of a meane ſtature: yet if you place a dwarfe aloft vpon the ſhoulders of a giant, <pb n="160" facs="tcp:10362:89"/> hee ſhall then bee able to ſee farther then the Giant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can.

And yet by your fauour, Sir, <hi>I take no ſuch matter vpon mee,</hi> or if I ſeeme to doe ſo, I hope I doe it with all modeſtie, and it can bee no more then this that out of ſuch Premiſes as they haue taught mee, I gather a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which they attended not.</p>

                     <p>The firſt, the thirteenth, and the foureteenth, I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely deny, hauing fully proued, againſt the firſt, that Faith is not a Knowledge or Aſſurance; againſt the thirteenth, that the onely proper Obiect of Faith is the Perſon of the Mediator, and againſt the foureteenth, that the Forme thereof is Affiance and not any ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Certainty. The ninth, ſixteenth, and ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth in part I deny: the ninth, where you make Faith and Knowledge to bee conuertible which I haue proued to haue different natures and Definitions; the ſixteenth where you affirme Reſting vpon Chriſt to bee an effect of Faith, which I haue demonſtrated to bee the Forme and proper Act of Faith; the ſeuenteenth, where you ſay that the ſubiect of Faith is both the Vnderſtanding and the Will, againſt which I haue ſhewed, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10362:94"/> for one and the ſame Habit to be ſubiectiuely in two ſeuerall faculties of the Soule. The reſt of your Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (ſauing the inconuenience of ſome tearmes, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a fauourable conſtruction vpon them) I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to bee true; and becauſe, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, I can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth, therefore I oppoſe them not, but readily and willingly yeeld and ſubſcribe vnto them.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Maſter Baxter,</hi> in all this long diſcourſe of Faith, hauing ſpoken ſo carefully of the Definition of Faith, of the vnity of it in kind, and difference of it in number and degree, of the imperfection, ſufficiencie, efficient, principall and inſtrumentall, of the obiect both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpeciall, of the forme, and end both Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Higheſt, finally of the Effects, Subiects, and adiuncts thereof: in all this long diſcourſe, I ſay, how is it that wee heare not ſo much as a word of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which notwithſtanding is the immediate and proper Effect of Faith? Immediate, becauſe it is the firſt fruite and benefit that ſpringeth of it, and commeth before Adoption and Sanctification: proper, becauſe it is the Act of Faith onely, and not of any other Grace which iuſtifies a man before God. Whether it were of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or of policy, that you haue omitted ſo materiall and neceſſary a point, I cannot ſay. If of negligence, it deſerues a ſeuere chaſtiſement: if of policy, it was I think you foreſaw what a dangerous conſequence would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon. For if you had placed Iuſtification (as needs you muſt haue done if you had mentioned it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Effects of Faith, the Reader poſſibly might haue reaſoned thus, If iuſtification be an Effect of Faith and ſo follow after Faith, then cannot Aſſurance of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification <pb n="171" facs="tcp:10362:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> bee Faith, becauſe it is an effect of Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and followes after: for it is neceſſary that a man bee iuſtified, before hee can bee aſſured that hee is iuſtified. And thus you had caſt away your whole pot of broth,<note place="margin">2 King.
4.39.</note> if you had not warily kept this <hi>Coloquintida</hi> out of it. But vpon what ground ſoeuer you haue forborne to ſpeake of this point, I will by your leaue ſupply this defect, and in a word or two ſhew you in what ſenſe I affirme that Affiance iuſtifies, and deny it of Aſſurance: for in ſome ſort Aſſurance alſo may bee ſaid to iuſtifie.</p>
                     <p>Iuſtification is a law-tearme, and is oppoſed vnto Condemnation. As therefore Condemnation is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a iudge pronouncing a man to be guilty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering him ouer to bee puniſhed: ſo is Iuſtification al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſentence of a iudge, but abſoluing and acquitting a man both from crime and puniſhment. Now there are three barres at which all men are arraigned, and three Iudges, who at their ſeuerall barres either iuſtify vs, or condemne vs, that is to ſay, the barre of God, the barre of Conſcience, and the barre of Men. If wee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at all theſe barres, and by all theſe Iudges, wee are of all creatures the moſt miſerable: if wee bee abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at them all, and by them all, of all men wee be the moſt bleſſed. Againe, if Men acquit vs, what booteth it, if our owne Conſcience condemne vs? and if our Conſcience acquit vs, what auaileth it, if God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs? for who can deliuer the prey out of the pawes of that Lion? On the contrary ſide, if men condemne vs, it mattereth not, ſo as our Conſcience doe abſolue vs: and if our Conſcience alſo doe condemne vs, yet happy are we, if God abſolue vs, for God is greater then our Conſcience. What that is,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.20.</note> for which ſentence of <pb n="172" facs="tcp:10362:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> Condemnation paſſeth vpon vs at any of theſe bars there is no queſtion, for it is well knowne to bee ſinne: ſinne I ſay which is ſo indeed, or at leaſt is ſo in appearance. For although nothing appeare vnto God otherwiſe then it is, ſo that there can bee no error in his iudgement: yet our owne conſciences and other men may eaſily bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and miſtaken, and ſo without cauſe oftentimes pronounce ſentence of Condemnation. What then is that by which wee are iuſtifyed and abſolued from our ſins, and the puniſhment of death due vnto them? Surely, that which is contrary vnto ſinne, euen Righteouſneſſe. What Righteouſneſſe?<note place="margin">Phil.
3.9.</note> for, as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there is a Righteouſneſſe which is of the law, and there is a righteouſneſſe which is of Faith: by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſhall no fleſh liuing bee iuſtified, by the latter eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that Belieueth is iuſtified. God iuſtifieth vs at his barre when hee ſeeth our Faith, that by firme Affiance wee reſt and rely our ſelues vpon Chriſt to bee our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, accepting him to bee our Prophet, Prieſt, and King: for then according vnto promiſe doth hee accept the Paſſiue obedience of Chriſt to ſatisfy for our ſinnes paſt, and imputeth vnto vs his Actiue obedience to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of that perfect legall righteouſneſſe which ſhould be in vs. Our Conſcience iuſtifies vs at his barre, when it is perſwaded that God hath already iuſtified vs: for as long as it is perſwaded that God condemneth, it cannot acquit vs. If the perſwaſion of the Conſcience be built vpon a ſandy and deceitfull foundation, it is rather vaine preſumption then true aſſurance, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it giueth is erronious: but if it bee grounded vpon infallible euidence, euen the teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> witneſſing with our ſpirits that wee are the <pb n="173" facs="tcp:10362:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſons of God, then is the Aſſurance ſound and certaine, and the ſentence pronounced thereupon iuſt and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note> whence preſently ariſeth in our ſoules ſuch vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable peace as paſſeth all vnderſtanding, and ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ioy as nothing can take from vs. Finally, Men iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify vs at their barre alſo,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.22. Mat.
5.16.</note> when our light ſo ſhineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, that they ſee our good works, which are the fruits of Faith and a good Conſcience, and thereby are moued to glorify our Heauenly Father: as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in the iudgement of Charity that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as they ſeeme to bee, euen iuſtified before God, and borne againe of water and the Holy Ghoſt. This iudgement becauſe it is built vpon probability onely, and not vpon certainty (for who knowes whether the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance come from the inward holyneſſe or hollowneſſe of the heart, but onely the heart it ſelfe, and God which made it?) May therefore bee erronious, and though proceeding from Charity, yet in the meane ſeaſon ſwaruing from verity. If then when Men iuſtify vs, our owne Conſciences tell vs, that they pronounce a wrong ſentence, and abſolue the guilty: the comfort that growes vnto vs thereby is no better then a cup of cold water is vnto a man ſicke of a burning feuer, or then the <hi>Sardonian</hi> laughter which makes the face ſeeme to grin, while the deadly poiſon is ſearching through eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry veine, and ſeazing vpon the very heart. But if wee bee well aſſured that the ſentence is iuſt and true, and that they are not deceiued therein, although it bee not the end wee aymed at, nor the Crowne wee looked for, yet is it a ſweet and amiable companion of holy life, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickely teſtifying vnto our great comfort that God hath been glorified by vs, our profeſſion honoured, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10362:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> others inuited if not gained vnto Chriſt. And thus much haue I thought good in regard of your ſilence to ſpeake I hope not impertinently, at leaſt wiſe not vnprofitably of Iuſtification: the ſumme whereof is that Affiance iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies before God, Aſſurance before Conſience, works before Men. So that I doe not ſimply deny either that Aſſurance is Faith (for in my Treatiſe I acknowledge that the Scripture ſometime calleth it Faith) or that it iuſtifieth (for I confeſſe it iuſtifieth at the barre of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) onely I deny it to bee that Faith which iuſtifies before God, affirming that Faith to bee no other then Affiance.</p>

Certainly it is impoſſible. For what is it of it ſelfe other then a fardle of vanities?

Nay verily but ſhee is ſtill of ſo noble and hautie a nature that ſhee ſcorneth to haue her conqueſts empeached by ſo baſe and diſhonorable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors. Deprauing of the aduerſaries words and meaning, impertinent digreſſions, diſſembling of his reaſons, and anſwers, vnchriſtian reuelling and reproaching, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous hoobubs and outcries, are the vſuall weapons of thoſe who reſolue to fight in vnrighteous quarels.

                  <p>Secondly, when <hi>Infants</hi> are preſented at the holy Font, and either ſprinkled with the water of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or dipped therein: how chanceth it that they ſo much diſlike thereof, teſtifying their diſlike by their crying and other motion of the body? Certainly, had they <hi>actuall Faith,</hi> they would endure all with much patience and cheerefulneſſe, and neuer bewray ſo much aduerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſcontent. But if in doing ſo they goe againſt their knowledge, the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> muſt needs bee ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rre from auailing them to the waſhing away of
<hi>Originall</hi> guilt, that by their reluctation they rather contract a further guilt of <hi>Actuall ſinne,</hi> which I ſuppoſe none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be too too vncharitable will imagine of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they haue <hi>Faith,</hi> why are they not after their initiation by <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> forthwith admitted vnto holy
<hi>Communion?</hi> In the time of Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> and
<hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt, it was the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> ſo to <pb n="196" facs="tcp:10362:107"/> doe: and it continued, as ſome write, for the ſpace of ſixe hundred yeeres, downe vnto the times of <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Lotharius.</hi> But why is that cuſtome now growne out of vſe, and why are Children barred from the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> if they belieue as well as elder people? Nay why are they not rather admitted then thoſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per yeeres? For <hi>Infants</hi> haue not ſo much as euill thoughts in them: but theſe by reaſon of their longer life haue made themſelues guilty of many euill deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth,
<hi>commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God preached.</hi> But
<hi>Infants</hi> heare not, neither by the eare, nor by any other way proportionable thereunto: or if they doe, yet they vnderſtand not what they heare. For did they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, I preſume they would harken more attentiuely vnto what is ſaid, then we ſee they doe. Wherefore not hearing, neither doe they belieue. If you ſay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue by an inward
<hi>Hearing:</hi> then is that <hi>Faith</hi> wrought either by
<hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary</hi> meanes. Not by
<hi>Extraordinary</hi> meanes, for it is done euery day and houre. By
<hi>Ordinary</hi> therefore. If ſo, then haue wee a double manner of working
<hi>Faith,</hi> and both of them <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:</hi> the one by <hi>Inward Hearing</hi> in <hi>Infants</hi> only, the other by <hi>Inward</hi> and
<hi>Outward</hi> alſo in thoſe that are <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> which is a meere nouelty in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, how commeth it to paſſe, if Children haue Faith, that among ſo many millions of them as haue beene in the world, not ſo much as one of them when they come to riper yeares, giueth any teſtimony of his
<hi>Faith</hi> vntill hee bee farther taught and informed? If a child borne of Chriſtian parents, and entred into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10362:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church by Baptiſme, ſhall afterwards while hee is yet in his tender yeeres fall into the hands of <hi>Infidels</hi> or
<hi>Turks,</hi> (as the more the pitie many thouſands of them haue done, and the whole band of <hi>Ianizars</hi>), they ſay, conſiſts of no other: doth hee not readily receiue that religion, which is firſt inſtilled into him, without once dreaming of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith?</hi> Which yet how it ſhould bee, hauing from his firſt infancy beene ſeaſoned and ſanctified with the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> cannot eaſily be conceiued or imagined.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, tell mee, doe all that haue receiued <hi>Faith</hi> in their infancy looſe it againe when they come to bee of more yeeres? It ſeemeth ſo, if then they receiued it: for otherwiſe, why are they put to their <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> and taught the elements of <hi>Faith</hi> againe? But this were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange courſe: For how ſhould they looſe it? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perhaps God ſecretly ſteale that from them which earſt he gaue them: which to ſay, is very derogatory to the bounty of God, who neuer withdraweth grace once giuen, vntill man by abuſing it haue deſerued to looſe it. Not looſing it therefore, and yet learning it when they come to yeeres of capacity, It is a plaine argument they neuer receiued it in their
<hi>Infancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly and laſtly, there is not the leaſt Habit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquired by cuſtome, or infuſed from aboue but maketh a man more apt and prone vnto their proper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For example, whoſoeuer is poſſeſſed of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Iuſtice, Temperance, Liberality, Fortitude,</hi> will readily doe iuſtly, temperatly, liberally, valiantly: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of
<hi>Habits</hi> to facilitate <hi>Actions.</hi> Tell mee then, are the Children of Chriſtians when they come firſt to be inſtructed more capable of Chriſtian Religion, <pb n="198" facs="tcp:10362:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> or more inclinable to holy actions, then the Children of <hi>Infidels?</hi> Experience tels vs they are not, but are as waxe indifferently flexible any way. It is abſurd therefore and void of reaſon to place in <hi>Infants</hi> the Habit of <hi>Faith,</hi> which yet inclines them no more to the Acts of <hi>Faith,</hi> then thoſe that are without it.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing thus briefly demonſtrated that <hi>Infants</hi> haue neither <hi>Actuall</hi> nor <hi>Habituall Faith:</hi> it followeth in the next place to anſwer the contrary arguments aboue ſet downe. And firſt where it is ſaid, that <hi>Faith</hi> is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes vnto
<hi>Iuſtification</hi> and <hi>Saluation,</hi> in as much as none can pleaſe God or liue without it: I anſwer in a word, it is to bee vnderſtood not of <hi>Infants;</hi> But <hi>de Adultis</hi> of thoſe that are of riper yeeres, vnto whom alone <hi>Faith</hi> is neceſſary. Theſe cannot pleaſe God, nor liue, nor bee iuſtified and ſaued without a particular <hi>Faith</hi> of their owne: but <hi>Infants</hi> by reaſon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity through the indulgence of God may. Adde hereunto, that according to the <hi>Tenent</hi> of our <hi>Diuines,</hi> it is not the
<hi>Habit</hi> but the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> that doth iuſtify: in regard whereof they define it by a <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> grounded vpon an aſſent of the <hi>Mind</hi> vnto the truth of the Goſpell. Vnleſſe therefore, you grant vnto <hi>Infants</hi> ſuch a motion both of the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> which <hi>Papiſts</hi> expreſly deny, and <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſeeme to ſtagger at, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they bee iuſtified by <hi>Actuall Faith,</hi> hauing none. And ſeeing without it the <hi>Habit</hi> auailes nothing at all, as being an idle
<hi>Faith:</hi> I ſee not to what end the Habit ſhould bee infuſed. And if it bee to no end, neither is it infuſed. For if <hi>Nature</hi> doe not, much leſſe doth God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in vaine.</p>
                  <p>To that of our Sauiour where hee ſeemeth expreſly to
<pb facs="tcp:10362:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> affirme that Little-ones belieue: I anſwer firſt, that thoſe Little-ones are not <hi>Infants</hi> properly, but ſuch men as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble little Children in holy Innocence &amp; Simplicity: in regard whereof they are elſewhere called by Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is Infants. Secondly,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25.</note> grant it that Children bee alſo meant, yet not ſuch Children as are infants, but growne to ſome ſtature and capacity. For although the Child whom Chriſt tooke in his armes, be called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a little Child: yet was hee both a follower and hearer of Chriſt, and ſuch a one as in ſome meaſure could vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſuch as were thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> little Children to whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> thought it not vnfit to write.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.14.</note> For as the text ſaith, hee was one that came of himſelfe being called: and farther, hee was capable of ſcandall and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which queſtionleſſe is not incident vnto <hi>Infants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to the example of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ep. 57.</note> I anſwer with <hi>Saint Auguſtin, Nec quod factum eſt in Iohanne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temno, nec inde regulam quid ſentiendun ſit de paruulis figo: immò id in illo mirabiliter praedico, quia in alijs non inuenio:</hi> Neither doe I contemne, ſaith hee, that which was done in
<hi>Iohn,</hi> neither doe I from thence frame a rule what wee are to thinke of little-ones: yea I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to bee marueilous in him, becauſe I find it not in others. Moreouer, it is not ſaid of him <hi>Credidit in vtero,</hi> he belieued in the wombe, but only <hi>exultauit,</hi> he ſprang in the wombe: &amp; this <hi>exultation</hi> or <hi>Springing, diuinitùs facta eſt in Infante, non humanitùs ab Infante,</hi> was done by the power of God in the Infant, and not by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power of the Infant Or if vſe of reaſon and will, were ſo haſtned vnto him as hee did belieue, <hi>in miraculis habendum eſt diuinae potentiae, non ad humanae trahendum est exemplar naturae:</hi> it is to bee reckoned among the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

                     <hi>Saluantur &amp; ipſi per fidem, non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuam, ſed alienam:</hi> they are alſo ſaued by <hi>Faith,</hi> yet not their owne <hi>Faith</hi> but anothers. Anothers? Will you ſay: this ſeemeth very ſtrange. Heare then what the ſame <hi>Bernard</hi> yet further addeth, <hi>Dignum eſt &amp; ad Dei ſpectat dignitatem, vt quibus fidem aetas denegat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priam, gratia concedat prodeſſe alienam:</hi> It is fit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto the dignity of God, that to whom age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a proper <hi>Faith</hi> of their owne, grace ſhould yeeld them the benefit of anothers <hi>Faith.</hi> And againe, <hi>Nec e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim omnipotent is iuſtitia propriam ab his putat exigendam fidem, quos nouit propriam nullam habere culpam:</hi> for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the iuſtice of God Almighty thinke that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Faith</hi> is to bee required of thoſe, whom he knowes to haue no proper fault of their owne. In which words of
<hi>Bernard,</hi> two excellent reaſons are rendred, why the <hi>Faith</hi> of another through the grace and indulgence of God ſhould bee auailable vnto them: the firſt becauſe their <hi>Jnfancy</hi> denies vnto them a proper
<hi>Faith</hi> of their owne, the ſecond becauſe beſides that
<hi>Originall Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> traduced into them from their parents without their knowledge or conſent, they haue no other ſinne of their owne. Can they not then by reaſon of their tender yeeres haue a <hi>Faith</hi> of their owne? It befits the goodnes <pb n="201" facs="tcp:10362:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God that they bee holpen by the <hi>Faith</hi> of another. Haue they no proper and particular ſinne of their owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither doth God thinke it agreeable with his iuſtice to exact of them a proper and particular Faith of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Infants then are holpen by anothers <hi>Faith.</hi> Whoſe
<hi>Faith</hi> will you ſay? The <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Parents,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Church,</hi> who is the common mother of vs all, and in whoſe wombe as it were they are conceiued &amp; borne. This of old was Saint
<hi>Auguſtins</hi> ſentence, and this all ſound Diuines haue agreeably with the <hi>Scripture</hi> euer held. Onely it may be demanded how and in what ſort the <hi>Parents Faith</hi> auaileth them. Whereunto I anſwer, not by particular applying of Chriſts merits and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto them (for this is done onely by a mans owne <hi>Faith</hi> vnto himſelfe) but by bringing them within the compaſſe of the <hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> Thus; The
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant</hi> was made not with <hi>Abraham</hi> onely,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.19. Act. 2.39.</note> but with his ſeed alſo: and the
<hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> was giuen both to the
<hi>Parents</hi> and to the <hi>Children.</hi> The Parents therefore by Faith apprehending this Promiſe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, by their Faith intereſt their
<hi>Children</hi> alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For as it is in ciuill negotiations, the bargaine that the Father maketh for himſelfe &amp; his Children is firme and good, although the <hi>Children</hi> bee not preſent at the bargaine-making, nor vnderſtand what is done: euen ſo in this ſpirituall Couenant and contract with God, the <hi>Parents Act</hi> is ſufficient force to confederate their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> alſo, and to giue them a right vnto all the benefits of the <hi>Couenant.</hi> And as I conceiue, this is imputed vnto them in lieu of all thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are required in thoſe that are <hi>Adulti.</hi> How farther
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10362:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Holy Ghoſt worketh in them is a deepe and inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſecret, <hi>Et de occultis non iudicat Eccleſia,</hi> the Church is no iudge of things that are hidden. Onely I affirme that by the Faith of the <hi>Parents</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> are made a holy ſeed, and members of Chriſts body.</p>
                  <p>But what if one of the <hi>Parents</hi> bee an
<hi>Infidell?</hi> What if either of them, or both be notorious hypocrites or openly ſinnefull, hauing not in them true Iuſtifying <hi>Faith?</hi> are the <hi>Children</hi> therefore, without the compaſſe of the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> and vniuſtified before God? I anſwer, No: For firſt, if but one of the <hi>Parents</hi> belieue, yet are the <hi>Children</hi> holy.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.14.</note> So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, The vnbelieuing husband is ſanctified by the belieuing wife, and the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing wife is ſanctified by the husband: elſe were your Children vncleane, but now are they holy.</hi> Againe, though neither of the <hi>Parents</hi> belieue with iuſtifying <hi>Faith,</hi> yet being in the Church by the profeſſion of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, their Children are within the <hi>Couenant.</hi> For firſt, <hi>the Soule that ſinneth it ſhall die:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.20.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father beare the iniquity of the Sonne.</hi> So that the impiety of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> preiudiceth not the Child that is borne in the Church. Secondly, by <hi>Parents</hi> are to bee vnderſtood not thoſe alone of whom Children are immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and borne: but their Progenitors and Anceſtors alſo who feared God and liued in the Church, though many generations before. For God made not his
<hi>Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his immediate ſeed onely, but with all his ſeed after them in their generations:<note place="margin">Gen.
17.7. Ex. 20.</note> and promiſeth <hi>to ſhew mercy</hi> to the thouſandth generation of them that <hi>loue him and keep his Commandments.</hi> Whence it followeth, that theſe are as it were a root vnto all their <pb n="203" facs="tcp:10362:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> poſterity borne in the Church: and therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> 
                     <hi>if the root be holy, ſo are the branches</hi> alſo, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Laſtly, bee the next <hi>Parents</hi> whatſoeuer they will bee, yet their <hi>Children</hi> being borne in the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> is their
<hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> and piety of the Church intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth all ſuch as are borne in her vnto the <hi>Couenant.</hi> And thus you ſee how Children are iuſtified and Saued by anothers Faith.</p>
                  <p>If Children, may not thoſe that are <hi>Adulti</hi> ſo bee
<hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> and <hi>ſaued</hi> alſo? No verily. For as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The iust man ſhall liue ſuâ fide,</hi> not by anothers,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4.</note> but by his owne <hi>Faith.</hi> And hence is it, that in the Lords prayer we are taught to ſay <hi>Our Father,</hi> but in the Creed, <hi>I belieue:</hi> becauſe Prayer is an Act of Charity extending it ſelfe vnto the good of others alſo, but Belieuing is an Act of Faith, onely benefiting a mans ſelfe. Can the cloths that another weares, warme mee? or the meat another eates, nouriſh mee? or the potion another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues, cure mee? or the ſoule that is in another man quicken mee? Nor more can the Faith of another man iuſtify or ſaue mee. As one man ſhall not beare anothers fault, <hi>ſed anima quae peccat ipſa morietur,</hi> the ſoule that ſinneth it ſhall die: ſo ſhall not one man bee acquitted for anothers <hi>Faith, ſed anima quae credit ipſa ſaluabitur,</hi> the ſoule that belieueth it ſhall bee ſaued. Saluation eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in Scripture is promiſed to him who himſelfe belieueth; and damnation is euery where threatned to him that belieueth not ſo. And he belieueth not ſo, who hath not a Faith of his owne.</p>
                  <p>Yea but if <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne bee imputed vnto vs for
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for
<hi>Iuſtification:</hi> why may not anothers <hi>Faith</hi> alſo bee imputed for <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation?</hi> 
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:10362:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> The caſe is not alike, for they were publicke perſons and ſtood in our ſteed: but ſo doe not others. In the <hi>Couenant</hi> of works <hi>Adam</hi> was our
<hi>Head:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſinne is counted the common act of all thoſe that were in his loines. In the <hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>Grace, Chriſt</hi> is our <hi>Head:</hi> and therefore his <hi>Obedience</hi> is eſteemed the common <hi>Obedience</hi> of all thoſe who are vnited vnto him by <hi>Faith.</hi> Others are not our <hi>Heads,</hi> nor repreſent our perſons: in regard whereof neither can their Act bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ours. It will further bee obiected that Chriſt forgaue the palſie-ſicke man his ſinnes for the <hi>Faith</hi> of them that brought him:<note place="margin">Luc. 5.20.</note> and ſo, as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith both
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> and one <hi>Iohn</hi> a Biſhop vnderſtand it.<note place="margin">Caten. in cum loc.</note> But Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> otherwiſe, and that more rightly, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it both of the ſicke mans Faith and theirs who brought him. For our Sauiour intending to beſtow a double benefit vpon him namely the cure both of body and ſoule: this could not bee effected but by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of his owne Faith, but the other might by the Faith of thoſe that preſented him. So wee read that the <hi>Centurions</hi> ſeruant,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.13. &amp; 15.28.</note> and the woman of
<hi>Canaans</hi> daughter were healed, the one for his Maſters, the other for her Mothers <hi>Faith.</hi> And who knowes not that vnbelieuers oftentimes temporally fare the better for the ſake of the <hi>Faithfull.</hi> Saint
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> therefore imputing the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes vnto the Faith of others, muſt bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with a graine of Salt, as they ſay, that one mans Faith may obtaine Faith vnto another, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the interuention thereof <hi>Iuſtification</hi> alſo: as did the
<hi>Faith</hi> of S. <hi>Steuen</hi> (as ſome ſuppoſe) vnto S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and the teares of <hi>Monica</hi> vnto her Sonne
<hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Thus thoſe that are <hi>Adulti</hi> muſt haue a Faith of their owne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:10362:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>And why I pray you more then
<hi>Infants?</hi> The reaſon is euident. For firſt thoſe that are
<hi>Adulti</hi> are capable of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo are not <hi>Infants:</hi> and therefore reaſon would that they ſhould haue a Faith of their owne, though theſe bee holpen by the Faith of another. Againe, they that are growne to riper yeeres haue in them more dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſeaſes then <hi>Infants:</hi> and ſo need more remedies then theſe. <hi>Infants</hi> indeed are borne in Originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propagated vnto them from <hi>Adam:</hi> but of
<hi>Actuall</hi> ſinnes they are not guilty, neither are they defiled with the fruites of that bitter root. And therefore vnto them ſufficeth thorow the gracious <hi>Couenant</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith.</hi> But to thoſe that are <hi>Adulti,</hi> who are ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not onely with

                     </gap>ne, but alſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Actuall</hi> tranſgreſſions by themſelues committed in thought, word and deed, it is requiſite that by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Faith</hi> of their owne they apprehend the merits and obedience of Chriſt for their <hi>Iuſtification</hi> and <hi>Saluation.</hi> In a word, anothers <hi>Faith,</hi> as is aboue ſaid, may by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine diſpenſation and indulgence ſuffice to him who hath onely ſinned in another: but to him who himſelfe hath ſinned, not anothers but his owne particular Faith is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Now, to conclude all with a little application, ſeeing all theſe things are ſo, firſt, wee haue here the great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge and prerogatiue of <hi>Chriſtian Children</hi> aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For by vertue of the Couenant they are a holy ſeed, haue right to the promiſes, and the Kingdome of Heauen belongeth vnto them. Hence is it that anciently vnder the law they were Circumcized, and now vnder the Goſpell are admitted vnto
<hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the ſeale of the <hi>Couenant</hi> of grace. In ſo much, that whoſoeuer of them <pb n="206" facs="tcp:10362:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> depart this life in their infancy and tender yeeres, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they are all and euery one of them ſaued. What ſhould let? Can they that are holy periſh? Will God fayle of his Word to thoſe that haue right to the promiſes? Shall they to whom the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen belongeth bee excluded from it? <hi>Originall</hi> ſinne is pardoned them in the <hi>Couenant,</hi> and waſhed away in the lauer of regeneration; other ſinne they haue none to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and therefore without doubt ſo ſoone as they die their innocent ſoules are by the holy <hi>Angels</hi> of God tranſported into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. Neither let any man thinke that herein I ſtand ſingle, and by my ſelfe, for thus a reuerend Biſhop alſo of this Church; <hi>I pray what did antiquity teach? that young Children Baptized are deliuered from Originall ſinne?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Carleton. ag. Montag.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee teach the ſame, and doubt not but if they die before they come to the practice of actuall ſinne, they ſhall bee ſaued.</hi> And our Diuines in the

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10362:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> Hee doubteth not but that many of the
<hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> are ſaued, partly by vertue of the Couenant, and partly by Gods election. By <hi>vertue</hi> of the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> in as much as they are deſcended of ſuch Anceſtors as haue apprehended the <hi>Couenant,</hi> although their ſucceſſion haue afterwards ſuffered ſome interruption. By <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> becauſe God hath not barred himſelfe from power and right to communicate grace euen to thoſe whoſe Anceſtors pertained not to the <hi>Couenant.</hi> For if hee call thoſe <hi>Adulti</hi> into the <hi>Couenant</hi> who before were not of it: why may hee not in like manner if hee pleaſe chuſe <hi>Infants</hi> alſo? Finally, as hee belieueth all that are in the <hi>Couenant,</hi> and that are elected, to bee ſaued: ſo in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hee preſumeth all that dye in their <hi>Infancy</hi> rather to bee ſaued then ſhut out of the Kingdome of Heauen. For my part, I will anſwer no otherwiſe then in the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>What haue I to doe to iudge them that are without? Doe yee not iudge them that are within? But God iudgeth them that are without.</hi> And ſo to his righteous iudgement I leaue them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here haue wee double comfort for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents. And firſt, in the birth of their Children: ſeeing they are holy and belong vnto the Couenant of Grace. True it is the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.7. Eph. 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>they are conceiued and borne in ſinne,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Children of Wrath:</hi> but you are to know that they repreſent a double perſon, one of a Sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the other of one ingrafted into Chriſt. As they are the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> they are bone ſinfull; as ingrafted into Chriſt, freed from ſinne. Secondly, in their death: for they may bee aſſured by <hi>Faith</hi> that they are tranſlated into thoſe ioyes, which eye hath not ſeene, nor eare euer heard, nor hath euer entred into the heart <pb n="208" facs="tcp:10362:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> of man. Of elder people they can but hope it in <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> of theſe they haue infallible certainty. If they liue vnto more yeeres, who knoweth but
<hi>wickedneſſe may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their vnderſtanding,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sap. 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>or deceit beguile their mind,</hi> as the wiſe man ſaith? But now being preuented by death, they are quickly paſſed this vale of miſery, and haue ſoone ended their painfull pilgrimage, and are poſſeſſed of the place of eternall reſt and happyneſſe. If any thing will drie vp the teares, or ſtint the ſighs and cries and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of Parents for the loſſe of their tender
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> this is it: eſpecially if they conſider withall, that themſelues vnder God haue beene the meanes of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them within the
<hi>Couenant,</hi> and procuring vnto them their euerlaſting
<hi>Saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Parents</hi> may hence learne that a neceſſity is laid vpon them to preſent their <hi>Children</hi> vnto the holy Font, ſo ſoone as conueniently they may. For ſeeing by their birth they are intereſted vnto the <hi>Couenant,</hi> the ſeale of the <hi>Couenant</hi> muſt not in any caſe be ſleighted or neglected. What though
<hi>Baptiſme</hi> be not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vnto them? yet is it neceſſary for <hi>Parents</hi> to giue it them conditionally, if it may bee had. If it cannot bee had, the <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Deſire</hi> of the
<hi>Parents</hi> is ſufficient: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the bare want of
<hi>Baptiſme</hi> without any of his or their default, exclude the
<hi>Child</hi> from <hi>Saluation.</hi> For if a iuſt and honeſt man would, much more will God performe his Word and <hi>Couenant,</hi> although the ſeale be not ſet thereunto. But if it may bee had, there is
<hi>Neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas praecepti,</hi> a neceſſity laid by Gods commandement vpon all thoſe that are <hi>Filij praecepti</hi> the Sonnes of the commandement. Thoſe Sonnes all men are when they are grown to be
<hi>Adulti;</hi> and therefore if then they neglect
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10362:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be baptized, they deſerue for their contempt to bee cut off and to bee eternally condemned. But <hi>Infants</hi> while ſuch are none of theſe Sonnes, as being both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the precept, and vnable to offer themſelues vnto the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> whence followeth that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement taketh hold onely of the Parents, and thoſe that haue the care of them. So that although the <hi>Child</hi> dying vnbaptized may bee free from danger: yet thoſe that neglect to preſent him vnto <hi>Baptiſme</hi> ſhall bee damned for breach of Gods commandement. Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> therefore by all meanes bee carefull to performe this duty: and if by reaſon of weakeneſſe or ſome other impediment it cannot bee done publickely, rather then left vndone, let it bee done priuatly. Wiſe men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>M. Caluin</hi> would haue it ſo: yea the Church of <hi>England</hi> requireth it, preſcribing a forme of Priuate Baptiſme, in caſe of neceſſity, and commanding that what is priuatly done be by the Miniſter publickely made knowne in the <hi>Congregation.</hi> An order heretofore too much neglected, God grant henceforward it may be better obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Finally and laſtly, ſeeing euery one that is
<hi>Adultus</hi> muſt of neceſſity haue a <hi>Faith</hi> of his owne, firſt it is the duty of <hi>Parents</hi> by all meanes to worke
<hi>Faith</hi> in their <hi>Children</hi> when they are capable thereof: that as they haue beene inſtruments to traduce <hi>Originall</hi> ſinne vnto them to their perdition, ſo they may againe repaire in them the image of God to their eternall ſaluation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let euery one looke to himſelfe, and ſee that hee haue <hi>Faith,</hi> for it is in vaine to truſt to the
<hi>Faith</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt indeed is a cloke large enough to couer the ſinnes of all men: but the <hi>Faith</hi> of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10362:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> another man is little enough for himſelfe, I cannot co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my nakedneſſe with it. They were but fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that ſaid, <hi>Giue vs of your oile, for our lamps are out:</hi> and fitly were they anſwered by the wiſe virgins, <hi>Wee feare there will not bee enough for vs and you, but goe yee rather to them that ſell and buy for your ſelues.</hi> Let <hi>Papiſts</hi> blaſpheme and ſay, they can ſupererogate and more then ſatisfy for their ſinnes, and that one man may for a price buy out of the Popes treaſury the Surplus of another mans merits: yet am I ſure the oile of another mans lampe will not ſerue my turne, nor procure mee fauour to enter with the bridegroome. God grant me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſdome euen while it is called to day, to get mee oile in my owne lampe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>OVING and Reuerend <hi>M. Bayly,</hi> I acknowledge my ſelfe much endebted vnto you, both for my kind entertainment, and the peaceable
<hi>Conference</hi> I had with you. Would you but vouchſafe to viſit my poore Cottage, I ſhould readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ſatisfy ſome part of the debt, if not with like entertainment, yet with equall <pb n="214" facs="tcp:10362:117"/> welcome. The reſidue I know not how better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, then by purſuing my firſt intention; that is, by labouring to reduce you backe into the boſome of that <hi>Church,</hi> out of which with ſuch danger to your ſoule, ſcandall to the brethren, and vnkindneſſe to her you haue withdrawne your ſelfe. And to this end might I haue obtained from you in writing, as at our parting I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what thoſe ſpeciall
<hi>Motiues</hi> were which had wrought in you this ſudden change: I would haue ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe by writing alſo to haue giuen them the beſt ſatisfaction. But ſeeing for reaſons beſt knowne to your ſelfe, and into which I liſt not further to inquire, you held it not fit as then to yeeld ſo farre vnto mee: I haue thought good for the preſent to reflect vpon ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our <hi>Conference,</hi> ſpecially that ground whereon you then ſtood ſo much, and vpon which you plainely profeſſed that you would aduenture your <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may pleaſe you therefore to remember that being demaunded a reaſon of your departure, you pretended that in reading the ancient
<hi>Fathers</hi> you had met with ſundry <hi>Bugbeares,</hi> which ſo ſcared and affrighted you, that vnleſſe you would reſiſt the light of
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> and hazard your eternall ſaluation, you could not chuſe but bee ſwayed by them. Whereunto it being replied, that happily thoſe <hi>Bugbeares</hi> were but <hi>Scarcrowes,</hi> and that you ſhould haue taken a ſafer and ſurer courſe, if you had reſolued your Faith into Scriptures, nothing being ſufficient to beare vp ſo weighty a peece but onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine teſtimony: your anſwer was that vpon Scripture you relyed, howbeit, becauſe it is obſcure and ſubiect to manifold conſtructions, vpon Scripture vnderſtood according to the interpretation and doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <pb n="215" facs="tcp:10362:117"/> nothing doubting but that as long as you held the Faith of them whom wee verily belieue to bee ſaued, your ſelfe could neuer periſh through misbeliefe. In which anſwer, howſoeuer in word you ſeeme to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſome force and vertue to the Scriptures, yet in truth you doe but cancell them and make them of none effect. For if the Scriptures lie rather in the Senſe then in the Letter, and the Senſe by reaſon of the darkneſſe and ambiguity of them, bee not to bee found in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but elſewhere out of them, in the writings of the Fathers: it followeth clearely that in your account <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other Pen-men of holy writ are no better then <hi>Cyphers,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>Cyrill</hi> and
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> and the reſt of that ranke as digit numbers vouchſafe to adde ſome value and ſignification vnto them. So that now by your fauor this muſt bee my taske briefly and plainely to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that hauing remoued your Faith from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture vpon the expoſition of the Fathers, you haue built quite beſide the rocke, and layd your foundation vpon the ſand.</p>
                  <p>But take this proteſtation firſt, that wee neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme nor deſpiſe the Fathers, as by Prieſts and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites wee are ordinarily ſlandered: but contrarywiſe, with all duty wee riſe vp to their gray haires, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their venerable antiquity. Withall wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they were in their times excellent ornaments and lights of the Church, endued not onely with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge in the myſtery of Faith, but alſo with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſanctity and vprightneſſe of life. Whereby, in all their combats and bickerins with Hereticks, they maintained the truth of God ſo wiſely and couragiouſly, <pb n="216" facs="tcp:10362:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they euer remained more then conquerors. And now as they haue left behind them a pretious name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints ſo wee doubt not but their ſoules are bound vp in the bundle of life, and enioy the bleſſed: making viſion of God for euermore. Such books of theirs as are come to our hands we eſteeme as rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and value them aboue gold. Them doe wee ſearch and peruſe with all diligence: bee it ſpoken without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no Papiſts more. Yet can wee not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them meet with thoſe terrible
<hi>Bugbears</hi> you ſo much complain of: rather wee wonder how you could miſſe all thoſe good Angels ſo frequently appearing in them to comfirme and ſettle you in your firſt Faith. For I wil bee bold to ſay, notwithſtanding all the brags and crakes of that ſide, that the Fathers are ours not yours: or if they bee yours in any thing, it is in the pettieſt and ſmalleſt matters, for in the maine and great queſtions controuerted between vs, they are expreſly for vs and againſt you, as hereafter God willing ſhall in part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Vpon confidence whereof, whenſoeuer wee were ſummond and called vnto the Fathers by you, wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer refuſed their triall, but euer haue beene ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture all vpon their verdict.

                     <hi>which</hi> Iewell <hi>moſt truly and constantly vttered that day when hee appealed to the antiquity of ſixe hundred yeeres, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you that if you could bring foorth but one ſentence cleere and euident, out of any Father or Councell, he would not refuſe to yeeld the victory vnto you: the ſame doe we all profeſse, we all promiſe the ſame, we will not ſhrinke from our word.</hi> Thus you ſee how wee reiect not the Fathers, as you would beare the world in hand, but triumph ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the teſtimony they giue vs, and in our Apologies and Defences alledge them plentifully againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit neither doe wee nor dare wee make Gods of them, or equall them with the holy Apoſtles, as if they were infallible and could not erre. Clouen tongues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſate vpon them, as they did vpon theſe: neither did the Spirit of God ſo guide and direct their pens, but that ſometimes they might faile, and write amiſſe. Had they had infallibility of iudgement, ſafely might wee build our Faith vpon them: but this they vtterly diſclaime, acknowledging it to bee the peculiar priuiledge of the Apoſtles. And ſo far are they from making themſelues Maſters of our Faith, that they require vs to iudge and cenſure of their writings by the Scripture which is the rule of Faith. Neither would they haue vs to tie our ſelues vnto their authority more then they tyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the authority of others but freely to accept <pb n="218" facs="tcp:10362:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> or refuſe as wee ſee iuſt cauſe.<note place="margin">Hom. 13. in 2.

                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. 19. ad Hieron.</note> Finally, <hi>I,</hi> ſaith the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtin, confeſse vnto your charity, that I haue learned to yeeld vnto thoſe books of Scripture alone, which now are called Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, this reuerence and honor, that I moſt firmely belieue no Author of them to haue erred any thing in writing: And if I find any thing in their writings which ſeemeth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to truth, I will not ſticke to ſay, that either, the copie is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10362:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> faulty, or the tranſlator apprehended not what is ſpoken, or I vnderstand it not. But others I ſo read, that how much ſoeuer they excell in holyneſſe and learning, I thinke it not therefore true becauſe they thought ſo, but becauſe either by thoſe Canonicall Authors, or by probable reaſon not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring from truth they were able to perſwade mee.</hi> Thus the Fathers: whoſe ſteps if wee tread in, and whoſe counſell if wee follow, and not taking vp euery thing vpon truſt, but examining them by the touchſtone of truth, I hope wee are rather to bee commended then blamed.</p>
                  <p>And reaſon: for neither were the Fathers more then men, neither are wee of this age leſſe then men. And I wonder, why we may not iudge of the ſayings of thoſe, who are but men as well as our ſelues. What? haue wee not reaſonable ſoules as well as they? are we not endued with the ſame faculty of vnderſtanding and diſcourſing? haue wee not ſtill the ſame helps both of nature and art which they had? Or when they died, did the Holy Ghoſt alſo giue vp the ghoſt with them? or doth hee deny to aſſiſt theſe latter times with his enlightning grace as hee did the former?<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note> Certainly the <hi>Spirit that leadeth into all truth</hi> is yet, and euer ſhall bee amongſt vs vnto the end of the world. And as before the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, hee directed his Church vnto the true ſence of Scripture: ſo now I doubt not but if all whatſoeuer they haue written were vtterly loſt, he would ſtill guide vs therein as hee did them. And verily vnleſſe wee will bee too vnthankfull wee cannot but confeſſe, that as age through Gods bounty hath had more meanes then thoſe heretofore: ſo through his bleſſing it hath made further proceedings alſo in the knowledge of Scripture. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10362:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> that wee haue whatſoeuer helps they had, we haue ouer and aboue the benefit of all their works, together with much skilfulnes in the Originall of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which moſt of them wanted, and of the new alſo, wherewith ſome were but little acquainted. In regard whereof whoſoeuer ſhall duly compare the ancient Commentaries with thoſe of latter times, muſt needs bee either weake in iudgement, or obſtinate in preiudice if hee preferre not theſe. Your owne men ingenuouſly acknowledge ſo much.<note place="margin">Art. 18. cont. Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>It cannot bee vnknowne to any,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fiſher B. of Rocheſter, that there are many things as well in other Scriptures as the Goſpels now more cleerely diſcuſsed and throughly vnderſtood then in ancient times: namely becauſe the Ancients had not the yce broken vnto them, or becauſe their age ſufficed not exactly to ſound the whole ſea of Scripture.</hi>

<hi>Salmeron, God hath not giuen to all men all, that euery age might enioy ſome truths which the former knew not. Euery age hath euer aſcribed much to antiquity: yet this wee auouch, the yonger the Doctors the cleerer ſighted.</hi> And <hi>Dominicus Bannes, Jt is not neceſsary that the more remote the Church is from the Apostles times, the leſse perfect knowledge of the myſterie of Faith ſhould bee therein: becauſe after the Apoſtles time there were not the most learned in the Church which had dexterity in vnderſtanding the matters of Faith. Wee are not therefore enwrapped in the more darkneſse, for that in reſpect of time wee are more distant from Christ: but rather the Doctors of theſe latter times being godly, and treading in the ſteps of the ancient Fathers haue attained more expreſse vnderſtanding in ſome things then they had. For they are like children ſtanding on the ſhoulders of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who being lifted by the talneſſe of Giants, no maruell <pb n="221" facs="tcp:10362:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> if they ſee further then they themſelues.</hi>

                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelfe in expreſſe tearmes affirmeth the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Iames</hi> to be Spurious: but your <hi>Chryſtopherſon</hi> renders it ſo as if he had meant that not himſelfe but ſome others in the Church had ſo eſteemed it in former times. And laſtly, not to ſtand longer vpon this point, that very tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</hi> which you haue, made by
<hi>Trapezuntius,</hi> you haue little reaſon much to truſt vnto. For as
<hi>Bonauentura Vulcanius</hi> ſheweth,<note place="margin">Praef. &amp; Ann.</note> it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſorderly one, wherein many things are omitted, much is added of his owne, and much peruerſly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. To conclude therefore, ſeeing the writings of the Fathers haue ſo many wayes and ſo notoriouſly beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, by addition, by ſubtraction, by alteration, by miſquotation, by miſtranſlation: it followeth that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty from them you can haue none, and ſo conſequently that you cannot ſafely build your Faith vpon them.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, the Scriptures you ſay are obſcure and ambiguous, and therefore you may not reſt vpon them ſaue onely as they are expounded of the Fathers. If ſo, then if the Fathers alſo bee obſcure and ambiguous, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may you reſt your Faith vpon them. Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fathers are as darke and doubtfull as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If you thinke otherwiſe, doe but read the works <pb n="236" facs="tcp:10362:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> of
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and let me afterward know your minde. For my part I ſee no reaſon why the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould bee more ſubiect to diuerſity of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the difference of times, as <hi>Cardinall Cuſan</hi> impiouſly affirmeth,<note place="margin">Ep. 2. &amp; 7. Cont. Whit. l. 2. p. 45.</note> and
<hi>Duraeus</hi> the Ieſuit impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently defendeth; then the writings of the Fathers. What? doe wee not vouch the Fathers on both ſides? are we not as confident vpon them as you? whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this, I beſeech you, if they bee ſo cleere that no doubt can bee made of them? And why doe you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in your <hi>Flemiſh Expurgatorie Index,</hi> that <hi>in ancient Catholike Writers, yee tolerate many errors, yee extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and excuſe them, and often deny them by deuiſing ſome ſhift, and faining a ſence vnto them when they are oppoſed againſt you?</hi> What need I ſay, all theſe tricks and fetches if there bee no obſcurity in them? If literall and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall conſtruction may cary it, the Fathers are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly ours: and wee ſuppoſe they ment as they wrote, neither can you make any ſhew of anſwer, vnleſſe you fall to expound the meaning of them. And ſo as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue your Faith from the letter of the Scripture vnto the expoſition of the Fathers: ſo muſt you of force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the ſame againe from the letter of the Fathers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other tribunall to determine the ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. Giue mee leaue to declare this by ſome few examples. That <hi>Faith only iuſtifies, Origen, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Euſebius Caeſarienſis, Hilary, Baſil, Chryſostome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auguſtin, Cyril, Primaſius, Heſychius, Gennadius, Oecumenius,</hi> in expreſſe tearmes affirme, agreeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with vs: whoſe words I will not fayle to produce whenſoeuer you ſhall require.

Againſt all this I know not what can be ſaid, vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that it might bee a generall cuſtome, but not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion. and ſo indeed ſome of your men turne it off, and the Councell of
<hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, <hi>that as thoſe holy Fathers had probable cauſe of their doing according to the reaſon of the time, ſo without controuerſie muſt we belieue that they did it not vpon neceſsity of ſaluation.</hi> But firſt, this is a queſtion not of Faith but of Fact, namely what thoſe Fathers did belieue in this point: and in a matter of Fact your ſelues confeſſe a Councell may bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Secondly, the ſayings aboue related are ſo plaine <pb n="246" facs="tcp:10362:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> and expreſſe as none can bee more: ſo that it muſt needs bee extreme madneſſe to yeeld vnto this conſequent, the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that is, a few men of yeſterday ſay ſo, and therefore though Pope
<hi>Innocent,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and other of the ancient Fathers ſay the contrary of themſelues, yet muſt wee not belieue them. Thirdly, the very Text of Scripture which they alledged to proue, their opinion, vnderſtanding it of the Euchariſt as they did, manifeſtly argues they held a neceſſity of it to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>Vnleſse you eat the fleſh of the Son of Man and drinke his blood yee ſhall not haue life in you.</hi> Laſtly, you are to know that the Fathers brought in this of the Euchariſt againſt the Pelagians to proue the neceſſity of Baptiſme, thus, None can bee ſaued without partaking of the holy Communion: None may partake of the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion except hee bee Baptized, <hi>Ergo,</hi> none can bee ſaued except hee bee Baptized. The Aſſumption they tooke for granted: the Maior they warranted by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid text. So that the Concluſion muſt of neceſſity fall to the ground, and Baptiſme cannot bee neceſſary vnleſſe the Euchariſt alſo bee neceſſary. And thus haue I diſcharged this obligation alſo, and haue made good my promiſe vnto you as touching this point. From which together with the other particulars aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I conclude, that the Fathers haue generally er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and conſequently that Conſent of Fathers cannot bee a ground of Faith, vnleſſe you will conſent with them in error.</p>
                  <p>Which will yet further appeare, if you will pleaſe to take notice that your own men orderly reiect them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Conſent. For why ſhould they doe thus after ſo many vaunts and brags, if they thought the <pb n="247" facs="tcp:10362:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> more part of them could not erre? Yet that ſo they doe,<note place="margin">Loc. l. 7. c. 1. n. 1. Rom.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10362:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> Fathers ſometime conſent in errour, yea and ſuch errors as the preſent Church of Rome condemneth with
<hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema:</hi> ſeeing ſixtly, the moſt learned of your ſide make no ſcruple to reiect the Fathers whenſoeuer they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent againſt them, and warrant their ſo doing with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe reaſons: ſeeing laſtly, they make not Conſent of Fathers, but the authority of the preſent Church, that is to ſay, the Pope for the time being, to bee the onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible iudge of Controuerſies: ſeeing I ſay all theſe things are vndoubtedly ſo, I will not bee afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the pretended Conſent of Fathers is too weake and deceitfull a ground for a man with ſecurity to build his Faith vpon.</p>
                  <p>For whereas you ſay that beleeuing as the Fathers did, if they bee ſaued (as doubtleſſe they are) you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſcary: take heed leſt this proue but a broken reed, and deceiue you in the end. For firſt, if for the reaſons aboue ſet down, you cannot be infallibly certaine which are the true Fathers, and what is their right meaning: how can you bee infallibly certaine that you belieue as they did? Againe, doe you thinke it ſafe to hold all their errors alſo? and becauſe they are not condemned for them, that you ſhall eſcape condemnation in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beleeuing them?<note place="margin">Cont.

Laſtly, ſuppoſe the Fathers conſenting erred not, yet are you neuer the ſafer. For the ſtrength of Faith exceeds not the ſtrength of the teſtimony, nor the ſtrength of the teſtimony the Veracity of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now the Veracity of the Fathers is but the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of men, and the Veracity of men is imperfect and inconſtant, euer leauing roome for that word of truth <hi>All men are lyers.</hi> Whence it followeth that your Faith being grounded only on the Veracity of men, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then an <hi>Acquiſite and Humane Faith.</hi> Whereby though you belieue all that the Fathers did, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing as they did, they may bee ſaued and you periſh. For they building vpon diuine teſtimony belieued with a Diuine Faith, and therefore, Sauing: but you relying on humane authority belieue onely with an Acquiſite and Humane Faith which ſaueth not, no not although the things you belieue thereby are true.

                  <p>Happily you will ſay, the Scripture is indeed the rule of Faith, and the law of the Church, but not the Iudge; or if Iudge, yet but a mute and dumbe Iudge: and if there bee not ſome externall, viſible, audible, infallible, vnerring Iudge to interpret Scriptures, and to ſtint all controuerſies, there will neuer bee an end of quarels, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will there euer bee peace and vnity in the Church. Indeed, the name of vnity and peace is a goodly thing, and a finall end of all controuerſies, might it bee had, were much to bee wiſhed for. But I feare the Church will not bee ſo happy, ſo long as it dwelleth in taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and is militant here on earth.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.18.19.</note> Otherwiſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle would neuer haue written thus to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>I heare that there bee diuiſions among you, and I partly belieue it: For there muſt bee alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approued may be made manifeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</hi> And the generall experience of former ages confirmeth the ſame, wherein God continually hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercized his Church, either with the fire of perſecutions, <pb n="260" facs="tcp:10362:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it might appeare who they are that loue him more then the preſent world: or with the tempeſts of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrines, that it might bee knowne who are chaffe, and who wheat, who ſound in the Faith, and who not. Beſides this, mee thinks the facilneſſe and eaſineſſe of the way which your new Maſters preſcribe vnto you, ſhould make you much to ſuſpect the goodneſſe of it. For whereas it is the good pleaſure of God that all men ſhould carefully &amp; diligently ſtudie the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2. &amp; 119.</note> reading them, and meditating in them night and day, to the end they may grow rich in all knowledge and vnderſtanding: you by your rule may ſpare all this paines, and though you ſit ſtill, take your eaſe, and fold your hands, yet if you belieue whatſoeuer your exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall human iudge ſhall dictate vnto you, you are ſafe and cannot miſcarry. Now among ſimple and vnlettered Papiſts who is this Iudge, but ſome Prieſt or Ieſuite? for other Iudge I am ſure they meet with none. A plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible courſe I confeſſe to many, ſpecially thoſe that are idle and loth to take paines, or weake and dare not truſt their owne iudgement, or ſuperſtitious and thinke they merit much by their blind obedience vnto their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But how plauſible ſoeuer it may ſeeme to fleſh and blood, ſure I am it is too broad to bee the narrow way that leadeth vnto life: and the Kingdome of Heauen will neuer be attained, vnleſſe it ſuffer more violence then ſo. I adde further, it is too preſumptuous to tie Diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence vnto humane policy, and for man firſt to deuiſe what in his wiſdome ſeemeth fitteſt, and then to reſolue that therefore God hath ordered it ſo. Yet this is the courſe your ſide ordinarily holdeth: you loue rather to giue lawes vnto God, then to take lawes from him, and <pb n="261" facs="tcp:10362:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> in this particular, to preſcribe what meanes God ſhould appoint to ſettle vs in the knowledge of his truth, rather then to vſe the meanes which hee himſelfe hath to that end appointed. If you thinke this too hard a cenſure, be it knowne vnto you that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Prince of Ieſuits reaſoneth ſo. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith hee,<note place="margin">De verb. Dei. l.

                     <hi>was not ignorant that many difficulties concerning the Faith would riſe vp in the Church: hee ought therefore to prouide ſome Iudge for the Church.</hi> What Iudge? Such a one doubtleſſe as by his ſole authority and ſentence muſt bee able to reſolue all difficulties. Which for as much as neither Scripture, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> any ſecular Prince can doe: therefore it muſt needs bee the Prince of Eccleſiaſticall, that is, the Pope.

                  <p>But to anſwer this yet a little more fully, I affirme three things. Firſt, that holy Scripture knowes not, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ancient Fathers acknowledge not, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as long as wee haue the Scripture there needs not any ſuch ſtanding humane Iudge in the Church, as you dreame of. As touching the firſt, if you know any paſſage of Scripture wherein God hath authorized ſuch a Iudge as you dreame of, I require you to ſhew it, for my part I know none. Expreſſe Scripture I am ſure you cannot ſhew: deductions and conſequences by your owne rule I haue no reaſon to admit. For example, if for proofe hereof you vrge that of our Sauiour to S.
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue prayed for thee that thy Faith faile not:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 22.32.</note> I would <pb n="262" facs="tcp:10362:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> demand who ſhall bee iudge of the meaning of theſe words? for I heare that Chriſt hath prayed for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but I heare not that hee hath prayed for the Pope, that his Faith fayle not: and I know Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was firme and conſtant in the faith vnto his liues end, but it ſeemes by Eccleſiaſticall Hyſtory that ſundry Popes haue made ſhipwracke of the Faith, and become Hereticks. If there be no Iudge to determine this doubt, why doe you thruſt ſuch a Iudge vpon vs? If there bee, who is hee? you will ſay, the Pope. Then thus you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Chriſt prayed for S. <hi>Peter</hi> that his <hi>Faith might not faile,</hi> by S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Pope alſo is vnderſtood, and this appeares becauſe the Pope ſaith ſo: therefore neither can the Popes Faith faile and conſequently he is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary infallible Iudge of the Church More briefly thus, the Pope is that Iudge, becauſe the Pope will haue it ſo. Nominate what other Iudge ſoeuer you liſt, and what other Text beſides you pleaſe, and the argument is ſtill the ſame, too weake to perſuade what you intend, vnleſſe by ſome new priuiledge out of any premiſſes you may conclude what you will. In a word, ſearch the Scriptures throughout, and you ſhall finde the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſeruice of men eſtabliſhed to bring vs to the Faith: but an infallible humane magiſtery and Lordſhip to command Faith, it knowes none. That prerogatiue Royall it reſerues onely vnto Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe the ancient Fathers acknowledge any ſuch Iudge, which is the ſecond point. If they doe, point I pray to the place, for hitherto it hath beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Many and ſharp bickerings had thoſe ancients with diuers and ſundry Heretiks, as <hi>Arius, Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Eutyches, Nestorius,</hi> and the like: yet neuer did they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10362:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> either obiect vnto them that they wanted an infallible Iudge, as you doe vnto vs, or conuent them before the tribunall of ſuch a Iudge, which doubtleſſe had beene a readier way then diſputation to ſtop their mouths, had there been ſuch a ſoueraigne Officer in the Church. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and manifold are the writings of the ancient Fathers touching the Chriſtian Faith, of which ſome alſo were purpoſely written to inſtruct vs in all the doctrines of our religion: and is it not ſtrange that ſuch men, in ſuch books, remembring carefully all other points, ſhould forget ſo maine and principall a point as this is? Nay more then this, <hi>Tertullian</hi> long agoe wrote a booke of Preſcriptions or Fore-pleadings againſt Hereticks: Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> alſo wrote foure books of Chriſtian Doctrine, wherein his direct intent is to preſcribe rules how to vnderſtand and interpret Scripture: And <hi>Vincentius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinenſis</hi> alſo hath written a ſhort Commonitory for the Antiquity and Verity of the Catholike Faith againſt the profane nouelties of all Hereſies. If theſe Fathers had acknowledged this your imaginary Iudge, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe that they no where mention him in theſe books? For certainly here was the proper place, and they could not without extreame ſupinity and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence omit him, had they knowne ſuch a one: ſuch a one I ſay, as vpon whom the ſecurity of Faith, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church dependeth. But this deep ſilence of theirs, and that in ſo due a place, and of matter ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, euidently argues that they neuer were acquainted therewith, and that it is but an Idole of theſe latter times.</p>
                  <p>Now if neither Scripture nor Fathers know ſuch a Iudge, I hope I may bee bold to inferre that the Church <pb n="264" facs="tcp:10362:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> needs him not, which is the third point. For I trow this is both a ſafer and ſounder kind of reaſoning then that of yours, <hi>Such a Iudge wee conceiue to bee neceſſary, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a one hath God ordained.</hi> But to cleere this point alſo, I affirme that the Scriptures by themſelues, through Gods bleſſing vpon our endeauour, is a ſufficient out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes to bring vs to ſaluation: and therefore there is no neceſſity of your externall Iudge. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is plaine and euident: the Antecedent thus I proue, becauſe all whatſoeuer is neceſſary to ſaluation is ſo cleerely and manifeſtly deliuered in them, euen to the capacity of vulgar and ordinary men, that if they will either read or heare it read vnto them, they cannot but know and vnderſtand it.

Beſides this, the Analogy of Faith teacheth vs, that Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <pb n="268" facs="tcp:10362:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> is a true Body like vnto ours: but that Body which you fancy to be in the Euchariſt is not like vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For in this Body there is no diſtance of one part from another, as of eye from eye, and head from feet, neither hath it any dimenſiue quantity, and is all both in Heauen and here on earth in the Sacrament at once, yet not in the middle region betweene, nor ſeparated from himſelfe: but nothing of this can bee affirmed of our bodies, or of any other organicall body. And if you ſay that you conceiue of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament as of a glorified Body, the plaine Scripture is againſt you, that when Chriſt ſpake theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> his Body was yet vncrucified and vnglorified. Your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therefore croſſing the <hi>Analogy</hi> cannot poſſibly bee good. As for ours thus we ſhew it.

How ſo? Thus. I looke into plaine Scripture, and there I find that as the Euangeliſts call it Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſecration, ſo Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> cals it Bread after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.<note place="margin">1. Cor.

Then I conſider further that our Sauiour now inſtitutes a Sacrament, and that in Sacramentall actions Sacramentall phraſes are vſuall, and the outward ſigne is called by the name of the thing ſignified: as in the old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.10.</note> Circumciſion is called the Couenant, and <pb n="269" facs="tcp:10362:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lambe the Paſſeouer, and in the new,<note place="margin">Ex. 12.11.</note> the Cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the new Teſtament or couenant.

You will ſay, this is to build vpon Conſequences, wherein it is poſſible to bee deceiued.

Secondly, to baniſh Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from Diuinity, is to baniſh the vſe of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and diſcourſe alſo: and that religion muſt needs bee driuen to narrow ſhifts, which cannot ſubſiſt vnleſſe men turne fooles or beaſts. Thirdly, the neceſſity of a Conſequence doth not any way depend vpon the perſon of him that inferreth it, but onely vpon the mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ſtrait coniunction betweene the premiſſes and it: ſo that by him who deſires to bee ſatisfied in the truth, not the perſon of him that deduceth it, but the Conſequence it ſelfe is to bee looked too, whether it bee rightly deduced or no. But who ſhall iudge that will you ſay? Indeed if you ſtand reſolued vtterly to renounce all the helps and directions both of reaſon and art, nor will yeeld to any Conſequence of Scripture how cleere and euident ſoeuer, but will only rely on the mouth and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of your humane externall Iudge: I confeſſe I am at
<hi>Dulkarnon,</hi> to vſe <hi>Chaucers</hi> phraſe, and you are paſt my skill infallibly to perſwade you. But if, as wee haue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10362:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhewed, nor Scripture nor Fathers acknowledge ſuch a Iudge, if all whatſoeuer is neceſſary to ſaluation bee ſo plainely laid downe in Scripture as a man of meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity may vnderſtand it, if what is more obſcurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in one place is more plainely expreſſed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if God haue appointed that out of the plainer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wee ſhould with ſtudy and induſtrie picke the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe that are harder, if hee haue promiſed that thoſe that aske ſhall haue, thoſe that ſeeke ſhall find, and to thoſe that knocke it ſhall bee opened, if finally though wee miſſe the true meaning of thoſe harder places, yet firmely adhering vnto the plainer, wee are ſafe and out of danger: then certainely the readieſt and ſureſt way to to interpret Scripture is by Scripture, and there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to determine controuerſies and to ſatisfy the conſcience but onely this. If any notwithſtanding this liſt ſtill to bee contentious,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul haue no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> The rule it ſelfe is infallible and al-ſufficient: if wee either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot, or through negligence doe not vſe it as we ought, the fault is not in God, but in our ſelues, neither doth hee faile in his prouidence, but wee in our dutie. Performe wee our duty obediently, and hee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe faithfully. In neceſſaries hee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faile: if in other things all be not of one mind, yet let vs ſtill proceed by the ſame rule, and inſtruct one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, and God will reueale that alſo in due time.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>M. Bayly,</hi> you haue what I intended for the preſent: it remaines that you peruſe it attentiuely. The ſumme is. The Fathers may be Miniſters by whom you belieue, but their Conſent is no ground of Faith. Your <pb n="271" facs="tcp:10362:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> externall humane Iudge is but a Chimera of mans braine, and not an Officer of Gods making. The onely al-ſufficient infallible outward rule of Faith is Scripture in the plainer places, which places alſo muſt interpret the difficulter. Beſides this albeit there may be a iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Church to order and controll the outer man yet to ſatisfy the Conſcience and inner man there is no authority but this. Which things being ſo, let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, and that in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence you are fallen and to caſt about yet againe, and by this rule to examine your new Faith.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>NTO the ſchedule you ſent mee, contayning your beſt reaſons for Sitting againſt Kneeling, I here returne you this ſhort anſwer. Your end doubtleſſe was by ſtrength of argument to withdraw mee from conformity in Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: my intent is, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering the weakneſſe of your arguments, to worke you from ſingularity in Sitting. The iſſue I leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: yet I truſt that as my perſuaſion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample this laſt Eaſter, as you know, reduced diuers, ſo my Reply through the bleſſing of God may alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime <pb n="274" facs="tcp:10362:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> you. God grant that being brethren, and children of one common mother: wee may with one accord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her orders, and honor her authority.</p>
                  <p>Your writing firſt maintaines ſitting, then oppoſes kneeling. Of ſitting you affirme thus, <hi>Wee ought to ſit at the receiuing of the Elements of the Lords Supper.</hi> In which Propoſition I doubt of one tearme, and ſuſpect another. The tearme I doubt of is this,
<hi>Wee ought to ſit,</hi> namely what you meane thereby. For if either the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Phraſe, or the Concluſion of your third Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme may determine it, then is it equiualent vnto this, <hi>We muſt ſit,</hi> &amp; imports a neceſſity of ſitting, or that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is the only lawful I geſture. But if we iudge thereof by the probable intention of the two firſt Syllogiſmes, then the meaning thereof ſeemes to bee no more then this,
<hi>We may ſit,</hi> or ſitting is a lawfull geſture. In which ſence now vnderſtand you this Propoſition? In the firſt? Then I deny it, and ſay <hi>Sitting is not the onely lawfull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi> In the ſecond? Then I anſwer two things. Firſt you haue ill expreſt your ſelfe, vſing words that beare not your meaning: for <hi>Wee ought,</hi> imports a neceſſary duty, and <hi>Wee may,</hi> free choice and liberty. Secondly I diſtinguiſh. For if you vnderſtand it Abſolutely and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſelfe, then I grant <hi>Wee may ſit,</hi> for ſitting is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and ſo there ſhall bee no controuerſie betwixt vs. But if you vnderſtand it reſpectiuely and with regard vnto the Canons and conſtitutions of the Church, then I ſay wee may not ſit: for the Church, vnto whom wee owe obedience, hath ordained otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, I ſuſpect thoſe words, <hi>at the receiuing of the Elements of the Lords Supper:</hi> for why doe you not ſay rather, <hi>at the receiuing of the Body and Blood of our Lord <pb n="275" facs="tcp:10362:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> eſpecially ſeeing this is the nobler part of the Sacrament, and the Elements are but ſhadowes of this ſubſtance. Was it, leſt ſitting might ſeeme too perfunctory, and kneeling neuer a whit too reuerent for ſo ſacred an action? If ſo, then are you guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no ſmall fault, thus to ſleight the holy Sacrament for ſo poore an aduantage. But perhaps it was done out of ſimplicity, rather then cunning. Howbeit taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to play the Logician and to diſpute Syllogiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you ought to haue been more wary of your tearmes. And ſo I paſſe vnto your arguments, the firſt whereof is thus framed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1</hi> A comely geſture ought to be vſed.
<hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.40.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sitting is a comely geſture; (for the affection of ioy muſt then bee ſtirred vp, with which it agrees. Mar. <hi>14.22, 23, 24, 25,
26.</hi> Ergo, ſitting ought to bee vſed.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is rather a Paralogiſme then Syllogiſme: for the Propoſitions are indefinite, and of no quantity, and out of ſuch Propoſitions nothing can Logically bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But I will help to rectify your Syllogiſme, if firſt I may know what you would conclude. The Concluſion muſt needs bee one of two, either this, <hi>Wee may ſit,</hi> or this, <hi>Wee muſt ſit.</hi> Would you conclude, <hi>Wee may ſit,</hi> in the ſence aboue denied? (for ſo you ought), Then muſt it thus bee formed, <hi>Any comely gesture may be vſed notwithſtanding the Churches ordinance: ſitting is a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geſture: Ergo, ſitting may bee vſed notwithstanding the Churches ordinance.</hi> But ſo the Maior is vntrue. For Magiſtrates haue authority to order things indifferent, as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10362:148" rendition="simple:additions"/> they find it expedient, to auoid confuſion, and to ſettle an vniformity: and wee are bound not onely for feare, but alſo for Conſcience to obey.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> Neither doth the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage you quote for proofe of your Maior, euince the contrary. For
<hi>Saint Paul</hi> commanding that <hi>all things bee done decently,</hi> permitteth not euery one to vſe his liberty as hee liſteth,<note place="margin">In. 1. Cor. 14.40.</note> but ſetteth bounds vnto vs rather, as
<hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> ſaith &amp; eſtabliſheth the lawfull orders of the Church: ſeeing it cannot bee decent to affront authority, and doe as we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>But it may bee you would conclude that wee <hi>muſt ſit,</hi> or that <hi>ſitting is the onely lawfull geſture.</hi> Then muſt your argument bee thus framed, <hi>A comely geſture onely is to bee vſed: ſitting onely is comely: Ergo, ſitting onely is to bee vſed.</hi> The Maior whereof I grant, and acknowledge to bee ſufficiently prooued; but I deny the Minor. For if ſitting bee the onely comely geſture, then is not onely the Church of <hi>England</hi> to bee condemned for kneeling, but ſundry other reformed Churches alſo for ſtanding, yea our Sauiour himſelfe with all his Apoſtles, who (as in due place ſhall bee demonſtrated) <hi>ſate not:</hi> to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that it is your ſingular opinion, and that the man cannot bee named who held the ſame before you, or holds it beſides you.</p>
                  <p>For as for your reaſon, that <hi>ſitting agrees with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ioy, which then must bee ſtirred vp,</hi> it is a very ſtrange and vnreaſonable one. For firſt, bee it that ioy muſt then bee ſtirred vp: ſo muſt humility, reuerence, thankfulneſſe alſo. And therefore if ſitting beecomely becauſe it agreeth with the one: Kneeling alſo is comely, becauſe it agreeth with the other. Againe, ſuppoſe that ſitting agree with Ioy: ſo doth leaping, dancing, exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10362:148" rendition="simple:additions"/> alſo. Why then if Sitting by vertue of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be comely, are not the reſt in like manner comely? Laſtly, that
<hi>Sitting</hi> is the <hi>embleme of Reſt</hi> and that ſuch poſture of the body is fit for ſtudy, counſell, meditation, I haue often heard: and ſo much is meant by thoſe old ſayings, <hi>The Romans conquer by ſitting,</hi> and <hi>By ſitting men become wiſe.</hi> But how it
<hi>agreeth with the affection of ioy,</hi> neither doe you ſhew it, neither can you: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leaue it as a fancy, vnkith vnkiſt, as they ſay, and paſſe to your ſecond argument, which you conceiue in this forme.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2</hi> Geſture according to order muſt be vſed.
<hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.40.</hi> Sitting is an orderly geſture: for Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſate, ſo did the Iewes alſo eating the Paſseouer.</p>
                     <p>Ergo Sitting muſt bee vſed.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This argument is euery way twin vnto the former, and in a manner needs no other anſwer then is already giuen. Neuertheleſſe, for fuller ſatisfaction let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine both the Propoſitions. The Maior being rightly vnderſtood I grant: for no geſture may be vſed but that which is orderly, it being the Apoſtles expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in the place by you alledged, that <hi>all things bee done decently and according vnto order.</hi> I ſay, being rightly vnderſtood: for there is a double Order, the one Intrinſecall &amp; in the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, the other Externall &amp; vnto vs. The former is that <hi>habitude, diſpoſition, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dence</hi> which one thing naturally hath vnto another: in regard whereof it may alſo be called a Phyſicall order or an order of Nature. The latter is that which is made ſo vnto vs, being preſcribed by lawfull authority: in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10362:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> whereof it may further bee tearmed, <hi>a morall order, or an order of Prudence.</hi> Now if you vnderſtand your Maior thus, No geſture muſt be vſed but that which is at leaſt one of theſe two wayes orderly, you vnderſtand it aright: for ſo is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, and in that ſence it is granted vnto you. But if you vnderſtand it thus, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny geſture which is in it ſelfe orderly may indifferently bee vſed by any, albeit the Church haue for orders ſake among many ſuch choſen out, and authorized one only: then doe you miſunderſtand it, and it is denied you: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> both here and elſewhere plainely declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee a great enemy vnto all ſuch Anarchicall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Minor</hi> is, that <hi>Sitting is an orderlie geſture.</hi> Whereunto I anſwere, that it is ſo indeed in it ſelfe, there being a naturall aptnes and fitnes in it to be vſed at the receiving of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> yet is it not in this ſence the only orderlie geſture: for Standing and Kneeling are ſo alſo, and may put in for a place as well as Sitting. Neither is it unto us orderlie, becauſe publick authority hath commanded Kneeling onely, which to diſobey, is, as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>to reſist the ordinance of God.</hi> Nor doth the example and practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Iewes proue the contrary. For the geſture they vſed, as it was orderly in it ſelfe, ſo was it generally received and approved by the Church at that time: but among us not Sitting but Kneeling is the geſture that is allowed and enioyned.</p>
                  <p>But if, this notwithſtanding, you will needs have that geſture orderly unto us now which Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, vſed, becauſe it was at that time orderlie, unto them: then know their geſture was not Sitting, and you <pb n="279" facs="tcp:10362:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> bewray your ſelfe to bee but a bad Antiquary in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it. For as all ſtory teſtifieth, it was the manner of thoſe times and long before, at meales to lie on their beds, leaning on their elbowes, and ſupporting themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with pillowes. And hereunto agree the words which the <hi>Euangelists</hi> vſe to expreſſe their geſture: for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Sitting, and vrge vpon vs a neceſſity of lying: or acknowledge that Sitting may not bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly vnto us, though anciently vnto Chriſt and his Apoſtles it were ſo. Your third and laſt argument is.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="3">3. If ſitting bee the only warranted gesture by Gods word, then it ought only to be vſed.</p>
                     <p>But it is the only warranted geſture: for it only was vſed by the Iewes at the Paſſeover, and by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles at his Supper.</p>
                     <p>Ergo ſitting only is to be vſed.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>That the word written (for ſo you meane) is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant of all actions, is more then you will euer be able to proue. For the law of nature written in the hart, and the light of reaſon are ſufficient warrants for many things. Otherwiſe, how could the Gentiles which had not the law written, be as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>a law vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> and how could their conſciences either accuſe them for breaking the law, or excuſe them for doing thereafter? Neither do I herein derogate ought from
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10362:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> Scripture: only I yeeld vnto Reaſon that which is her due. They are both from God, and both are to be our directors: the one in thoſe things that fall within the compaſſe of nature, the other in thoſe things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature. In things ſupernaturall Scripture is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant, Reaſon being therein ſtarkblind: In things Morall it is the ſafeſt warrant, Reaſon therein being but dimſighted. But to make Scripture the only warrant in all things without exception, is to put out the ſight of Reaſon, and to make it ſtarke blind in euery thing. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I confeſſe is perfect, but as a creature perfect in its kinde. Whatſoeuer is neceſſarie vnto that end whereto it was ordained,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15.</note> namely <hi>to make the man of God wiſe vnto Saluation,</hi> it containeth abundantlie, and with <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>

                     <hi>I adore the fulnes thereof.</hi> Other things if it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant not, it no way impeacheth the perfection thereof, becauſe they are impertinent and make not vnto the end thereof. The ſequele therefore of your Maior is not good, and it is abſurd and idle, in things not neceſſary to ſaluation to argue, from authority of Scripture nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, it ſaith not ſo <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing the Conſequence of your Maior to be good, how proue you the Minor, that Sitting is onely warranted by Gods word? Forſooth, <hi>becauſe it onely was vſed by the Iewes at the Paſſeouer, and by Christ and his Apostles at his Supper.</hi> Firſt I haue ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated aboue, that they ſate not: and therefore Sitting is ſo farre from being only warranted, that by your rule it is not warranted at all. Secondly, grant they ſate, yet it followes not thereupon that Sitting only is warranted. For as for the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ex. 124
11.</note> neither do their Ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us, and at the firſt it ſeemes they ſtood. For they <pb n="281" facs="tcp:10362:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> were commanded to eat the <hi>Paſſeouer, with their loines girt, their ſhoos on their feet, &amp; their ſtaues in their hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 25.</note>
                     <hi>and in hast:</hi> and, as they were commanded, ſo they did. As touching Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">(Suppoſing they ſate.)</note> their act indeed ſufficiently proues that Sitting is in it ſelfe, and was vnto them lawfull, ſeing the wiſedome of Chriſt otherwiſe, would not haue vſed it: but that it is the onely lawfull geſture it cannot poſſibly prooue. If it could, by the ſame reaſon it would follow that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is only to bee adminiſtred at euening and after ſupper, becauſe Chriſt then adminiſtred it. For they are both circumſtances, and not eſſentiall: <hi>&amp; idem jus Titio quod Sejo,</hi> there is the ſame reaſon of both.</p>
                  <p>You will yet happily demand, why wee make not Chriſts geſture a precedent for ours? are we wiſer then Chriſt? And I againe demand of you, why you lie not on your beds as Chriſt did: know you what is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient better then he? your anſwer I ſuppoſe will be, that Chriſts geſture, was that which ordinarily they then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at meales: and Sitting is that which ordinarily they now vſe. And I anſwer, becauſe wee receiue not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with our meales, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles firſt did, therefore do we not vſe the geſture of meales. The cauſe of the geſture being taken away, the geſture it ſelfe may bee changed alſo.

<hi>Laodicea,</hi> and of <hi>Trullo</hi> forbidding <hi>Agapas,</hi> that is, the loue feaſts, with which they were wont to receive the Communion, forbad alſo <hi>accubitus sternere</hi> to lie any <pb n="282" facs="tcp:10362:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> more in the Churches vpon their beds. So that in the wiſdome of the Churches of both Teſtaments, ſuch circumſtances may iuſtly bee varied as the cauſes or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of them doe vary.</p>
                  <p>And thus of your arguments for ſitting: now let vs take a view alſo of your reaſons againſt Kneeling. They are in number foure, all as you thinke demonſtratiue, and out of neceſſary premiſſes concluding, that we may at no hand Kneele. The firſt is this:
<q>
                        <hi>1</hi> If Kneeling ought to bee vſed, then it is conuenient. But it is not conuenient. <hi>2</hi> Chron. <hi>6.13.</hi> Dan.
<hi>6.11.</hi> Ergo, it is not to be vſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Maior of this Syllogiſme is <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> or
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall,</hi> the <hi>Conſequence</hi> whereof is grounded vpon this <hi>Categoricall,</hi> or <hi>ſimple Propoſition,</hi> Nothing ought to be vſed but that which is conuenient.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> Whereunto I anſwer, firſt, as we may not doe euill that good may come of it: ſo neither may we forbeare that good which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs for any euill or inconuenience that may follow thereof. Secondly, in things indifferent which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor euill, if they bee not ordered by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but are ſtill arbitrary and left vnto our choice, then as wee may vſe them becauſe they are lawfull, ſo may wee not vſe them when they proue inexpedient. The rule of charity muſt ouerrule vs in this caſe. But if once they bee ordered by publicke authority, then neceſſity is laid vpon vs, and wee muſt conforme our ſelues vnto order notwithſtanding any pretended inconuenience. The rule of loyalty muſt ſway with vs in this caſe. Bee it then that <hi>Kneeling is inconuenient;</hi> it was the fault of our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors <pb n="283" facs="tcp:10362:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> to command i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Now it is commanded, and it is our duty to obey them. If it bee inconuenient to Kneele: it is more inconuenient to diſobey, and for not Kneeling to bee barred from the Sacrament. The ſequele there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of your Maior is not good, and I require you to proue it.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption is, <hi>Kneeling is not conuenient.</hi> I deny it. You proue it by two places of Scripture, which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that
<hi>Salomon</hi> &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi> kneeled when they prayed. The weakneſſe of which proofe that you may the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily perceiue, I reduce it into forme, thus. <hi>That geſture which is vſed in prayer, is not conuenient at the Sacrament. But Kneeling is a geſture vſed in Prayer. Ergo, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient at the Sacrament.</hi> The Minor whereof I grant: but I deny the Maior as being too palpably ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. For firſt, neuer man yet dreamed that Kneeling is <hi>proper quarto modo</hi> vnto it, and may not bee vſed in any other action. Secondly, then may wee neither ſit nor ſtand at the Sacrament,<note place="margin">1 King. 19.4.</note> becauſe <hi>Elias</hi> prayed ſitting and the <hi>Publican</hi> ſtanding:<note place="margin">Luc.
18.13.</note> yea happily no geſture is left for the Sacrament, ſeeing Prayer hath ingroſt them all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand. Laſtly, for as much as at the time of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our affections are to bee aduanced and lifted vp vnto God in prayer and thankeſgiuing: it muſt needs be by your owne rule, that Kneeling is a geſture euery way conuenient for it. Your ſecond argument is,
<q>

                           <hi>2</hi> No will-worſhip may bee vſed. Mat. 15.9. Kneeling is will-worſhip: for Pope Honorius firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it. Acts &amp; Mon. pag. <hi>1390.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ergo, Kneeling may not bee vſed.</p>

                  <p>Your Aſſumption that <hi>Kneeling is Wil-worſhip</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: telling you further that you doe intolerable wrong vnto the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> charging her with ſo groſſe a Superſtition. For the world knoweth, and you muſt needs be a great ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael</hi> if you be ignorant, that the Gouernors of our Church preſſe not their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vpon the conſciences of men, as if they were in themſelues neceſſary and not indifferent: neither place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of Religion or diuine worſhip in them. This they leaue vnto that <hi>Man of ſin,</hi> who challengeth power vnto <pb n="285" facs="tcp:10362:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> himſelfe, as to create new articles of faith, ſo to preſcribe new formes of Worſhip alſo.

                  <p>Howbeit to proue your Minor you affirme that Pope

                        </gap> Miſſ.</note> It is true indeed that <hi>Honorius</hi> the third decreed, that Prieſts ſhould often teach their people, reuerently to bow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at the Eleuation of the Hoſte when Maſſe is ſaid, and when the Prieſt carries it to one that is ſicke, and I deny not but thereby he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Adoration of the Hoſte. But you ſhould know that it is one thing to receiue the Communion Kneeling, another thing to Kneele at the Eleuation when there is no Receiuing. This <hi>Honorius</hi> decreed, not that, for ought I can learne. Nay further, what that geſture was which ſucceeded <hi>accubitus, lying on beds,</hi> whether it were kneeling, or ſtanding, or ſitting, I ſuppoſe he who is well acquainted with Eccleſiaſticall Story can hardly determine, much leſſe you whoſe reading therein paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not beyond the booke of Martyrs. Let euery one herein abound in his owne ſence: I for my part thinke it was Kneeling rather then any other, becauſe it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of moſt reuerence.<note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> a learned man who wrote the ſtory of this Sacrament, hath theſe words,
<hi>This Sacrament ought to bee handled with great Religion and reuerence, according to the cuſtome of euery Church, with decent apparell, temperate behauiour, ſoberly, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, the head bare, the knees bent, and other ſuch like free ceremonies. And this reuerence or honour I doubt not but
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10362:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome of the Fathers aboue cited vnderſtood by the word A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration. For to Adore ſometime ſignifieth, as all know, externall reuerence and veneration exhibited by bodily ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and ſpeech vnto a thing, as when the knees are bent, the body is bowed, the head vncouered, the hands lifted vp, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far <hi>Hoſpinian,</hi> by whoſe iudgement Kneeling in all likely-hood was vſed long before
<hi>Honorius</hi> liued, or the <hi>Reall Preſence</hi> was dreamed of. Howſoeuer, it is meere foppery to imagine that a thing in it ſelfe lawfull once abuſed to a bad end, can neuer recouer its right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and bee lawfully vſed: and then taking this for granted, to preiudice our reuerent receiuing by Romiſh practice and ſuperſtition. I conclude therefore this point with that excellent ſaying of <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom.

                     <hi>when thou receiueſt that holy meat and incorruptible banket, when thou enioyeſt that Bread and Cup of life, and eateſt and drinkeſt the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of the Lord, then the Lord entreth vnder thy roofe. Thou therefore humbling thy ſelfe, imitate the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion and ſay, Lord I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come vnder my roofe.</hi> The third argument.</p>

<hi>1.</hi> Theſs. <hi>5.22.</hi> Kneeling is a ſhew of euill, as of Bread worſhip. Ergo, Kneeling muſt bee eſchewed.</q>
                  <p>Firſt I interprete the Maior. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words in the place by you quoted are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: which may bee rendred thus, <hi>Abstaine from all kind of euill.</hi> For the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifieth kinde: and in this ſence the
<hi>Syriacke</hi> tranſlation vnderſtandeth it. And interpreting it thus, the Maior is vniuerſally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception true: for no euill whatſoeuer, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally <pb n="287" facs="tcp:10362:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> and formally ſo, may in any caſe bee done. Beſides this expoſition there is another more generally approued, <hi>Abſtaine from all ſhew of euill or euill ſhew.</hi> For as euill it ſelfe muſt bee refrained that God bee not offended nor our Conſciences diſquieted: ſo muſt ſhew of euill alſo bee auoided, that wee ſcandall not our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor diſcredit our profeſſion. But in this ſence the Maior is not vniuerſally and without exception true. For firſt, it holds not in neceſſary duties commanded by God, nor in things indifferent ordered by man. For the ſubſtance muſt not bee neglected becauſe of a ſhadow: nor wee fall into the reall euils of Diſobedience and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, to auoid the ſhew of euill. Againe it holds not in Imaginary ſhewes, ſuch as are without ground fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſicke braines of humorous and malecontented people: but ſuch onely as indeed carry with them a ſhrewd preſumption of that euill whereof it is a ſhew. And thus the Maior is granted vnto you, in the former ſence abſolutely and ſimply, in the latter reſpectiuely with theſe reſtrictions and limitations.</p>
                  <p>Now to the Minor I anſwere, firſt Kneeling is not formally euill, but of an indifferent and middle nature, neither good nor euill: and therefore is not forbidden by the former interpretation, <hi>Abſtaine from all kind of euill.</hi> Secondly, I denie it to bee <hi>a ſhew of euill.</hi> For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof? Of <hi>Bread worſhip</hi> you ſay. How ſo, ſeing we are neither <hi>Tranſubstantiators</hi> nor <hi>Conſubſtantiators,</hi> and haue long ſince openly before all men diſclaimed both <hi>Eleuation &amp; Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>tion?</hi> And to whom? To Papiſt or Proteſtant? Certainly neither: for the one condemnes vs for not adoring, and the other ſuſpects vs not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring. So that the
<hi>Shew of Breadworſhip</hi> lieth not in our <pb n="288" facs="tcp:10362:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> Kneeling, but in your Imagination. Which if it be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to barre vs from Kneeling, I muſt entreat you for the ſame reaſon to abſtaine from Sitting:<note place="margin">See Tertull. de orat. c. 12.</note> for I can eaſily imagine in it a ſhew of euill, namely of Sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Contemning the Sacrament. Nay I muſt pray you to ſit ſtill and do nothing: for what is it wherein a man may not fancie ſome euill ſhew or other? Laſtly, ſuppoſe Kneeling haue the ſhew you ſpeake of, yet is it not to be forborne, becauſe it is in the number of thoſe things that are excepted from the generall rule. For it is commanded by authority, and to receiue the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is a neceſſary duty which among us without Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cannot bee done. Now as I haue ſaid, to auoid ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming euill we may not be euill, and for feare of a ſhadow looſe the ſubſtance, I meane the benefit and comfort of the Sacrament. And thus your argument drawen from the ſhew of euill proues as you ſee but the ſhew of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. I come to the laſt reaſon.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:10362:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> from the greater to the leſſe ſufficiently euinceth it. For if we may not fall downe to adore an Angell, much leſſe may we do ſo to bread and wine. And as we may not, ſo wee do not. Our Kneeling is not intended unto bread and wine, but vnto God who in the Sacrament offereth vnto vs the bleſſed body and bloud of his ſonne, who is God alſo, and to bee worſhipped of vs for euermore. You might therefore well haue forborne this argument which neither preiudiceth vs, nor aduantageth your ſelfe any whit at all: or if you haue any other meaning, you ſhould haue better expreſt it. For my part I cannot gueſſe what it ſhould bee, nor will I trouble my braine in ſeeking it. Happily your ſelfe know not what you would.</p>
                  <p>And thus haue I though breefly, yet fully anſwered all your reaſons. It now remaineth, that either you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſounder arguments then yet you haue giuen vs, or adde more vigor and ſtrength vnto theſe: or (becauſe I feare you can do neither) that conſidering the weaknes of thoſe reeds whereon you haue hitherto leaned, hence forward you truſt them no more. It can bee no diſgrace vnto you to bee ouercome of Truth: neither is it leuity or inconſtancy vpon ſight of your errour to change both your opinion and practice. Take therefore vnto you Chriſtian ſeuerity, and ingenuouſly reuoke what you haue held or done amiſſe: ſo ſhall you giue glorie vnto God, and God ſhall honour you in the ſight of all his Saints. But if, notwithſtanding all that hath beene ſaid, you meane ſtill to perſiſt in your error, and will not bee perſuaded although you be perſwaded: I feare leſt after ſtraining at theſe gnats, you fall to ſwallowing downe of Camels, and proceed from diſlike of a few

So doe almoſt all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the fourth age after Chriſt and downeward, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Apoſtles hauing receiued the Holy Ghoſt at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ready to diſperſe themſelues into all parts of the world to preach the <pb n="298" facs="tcp:10362:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> Goſpell, thought it good before their parting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile this Symbole, that it might ſerue as a pledge of their vnity in the Faith, and a canon for their doctrine and teaching. Yea ſome of them proceed ſo farre as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to ſet downe what article was made by what Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: whereof ſee <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his hundred and fifteenth Sermon <hi>de tempore.</hi> Now although it bee very hard for mee to ſway againſt the ſtreame of ſo maine authority: yet can I not but doubt thereof,<note place="margin">Paraphr. in Mat.

                  <p>For firſt, were it compiled by them, is it likely that Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> writing the hiſtory of their Acts, would haue omitted ſo principall a matter? Sundry other things of farre leſſe conſequence hee hath carefully recorded: but of this ſo important and weighty a buſineſſe hee makes not ſo much as one word mention, which certainly hee would neuer haue failed to doe, had they done ſo. Adde hereunto that not one of the ancient Fathers who liued within the three firſt <hi>Centuries of Chriſt</hi> ſpeake of any ſuch thing in any of their writings: and yet they ſhould beſt know it whoſe times were neereſt vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. This deep ſilence both of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and all thoſe ancient Doctors, make it vnto mee more then probable that the Apoſtles neuer compoſed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the ſilence of theſe worthies, ſo the very language of the Creed conuinceth it to bee yonger then the Apoſtles. For the word Catholike vſed in the Creed was not knowne in their time. Can any man thinke that the Church ſhould then bee called Catholike when it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10362:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> was not Catholike? For when they ſay this Creed was compiled, the Church was ſcarce begunne among the Iewes, and the Apoſtles had no where as yet preached the Goſpell among the Gentils. But heare the expreſſe words of <hi>Pacianus Biſhop of Barcilona, Sed ſub Apoſtolis,</hi>

Bee it ſo. Yet by your leaue when after the Apoſtles hereſies were riſen vp, and by diuerſity of names they laboured to rent and teare in peeces the done and queene of God: was it not requiſite that thoſe which were Apoſtolike ſhould haue a ſirname of their owne, whereby the vnity of thoſe that are vncorrupt might bee diſtinguiſhed, and the error of none might rent in peeces the immaculate virgin of God? Thus hee. Againſt which if it bee obiected, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of Iames, Peter, Iohn, and Iude</hi> are called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: I anſwer, the Inſcriptions and Subſcriptions of the Epiſtles are not Apoſtolicall, but added to them by ſome other, and ſometime vntruly. Neither is there any reaſon they ſhould bee ſo ſtiled aboue the reſt. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the doctrine contained in them more Catholicke then of all the other Epiſtles, neither were they written to all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> more then the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> neither were they all written to all Catholicks, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third of
<hi>Iohn</hi> were ſent vnto priuate perſons onely, and all the reſt as vniuerſally concerne all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks <pb n="300" facs="tcp:10362:160"/> as theſe few tearmed Catholicke doe. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, the word Catholicke being latter then the Apoſtles, ſo muſt the Creed bee alſo which vſes it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the different relation of the ſtory bewrayes the vncertainty of it: for they giue not all the ſame arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle vnto the ſame Apoſtle. Some marſhall them iuſt as S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth in the firſt of the Acts: others thus, <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iohn, Iames</hi> the elder,
<hi>Thomas, Iames</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Bartlemew, Mathew, Simon, Iude, Mathias.</hi> Againe, ſome of them attribute vnto <hi>Peter</hi> part onely of the firſt article, <hi>I belieue in God the Father almighty,</hi> and vnto
<hi>Iohn</hi> the other part <hi>Maker of Heauen and Earth.</hi> But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers attribute the whole article vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> and giue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vnto
<hi>Iohn.</hi> The like may bee obſerued in other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. If then they bee certaine of the tradition, why doe they differ thus in their reports? If they differ thus one from another, who can bee certaine of the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the Creed both for matter &amp; forme were from the Apoſtles, and they deliuered it preciſely in thoſe words in which we now haue it, why is it not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Canon of Scripture? Certainly in the Church although it euer haue been much eſteemed, yet was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer counted Canonicall. Neither hath it been preſerued ſo ſafe from addition, detraction, mutation, as the reſt of the Scriptures always haue been. For euen in the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt times we find great variety in it. <hi>Ruffin</hi> writing a iuſt comment on it, omits that clauſe <hi>Maker of Heauen and Earth.</hi> And who knowes not how many there are who relating this Creed leaue out the article of Chriſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell?<note place="margin">De Chriſti anima. c. 6</note> Euen <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelfe, confeſſeth
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10362:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it was not found anciently in all Creeds: and hee voucheth for it <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Tertullian, and Augustin</hi> though fiue times he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, and finally the Creed of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> alſo as <hi>Ruffin</hi> witneſſeth vnto whom if hee had been ſo pleaſed, he might haue added a whole armie of others, whom for breuities ſake I omit. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ancient Doctors were ſo farre from equalling it with Scripture, that they appealed from it thereunto as to an higher authority.<note place="margin">Catech. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Cyril</hi> plainely affirmeth that wee may not beleeue the Creed without Scripture.<note place="margin">Biblioth. ſanc. Patr. tom. 9.</note> And <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> ſhrowding himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome words of the Creed, appealeth vnto the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scripture, for that of it, ſaith hee, the text of the Creed dependeth. Which had they thought it had been from the Apoſtles in ſuch forme and as now we haue it, without queſtion they neuer would haue done.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the reaſon which they aſſigne why they compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Creed, diſcouers the vanity thereof. What was that? That it might be forſooth vnto the Apoſtles a canon &amp; rule, according to which they ſhould ſquare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their preaching. What vnto the Apoſtles to whom Chriſt promiſed his bleſſed Spirit that ſhould lead them into all truth? And that himſelfe would put into their mouths a ready anſwer vpon all occaſions, ſo that they ſhould not need to bethinke themſelues what to ſay? Could they poſſibly doubt leſt any difference or diſcord ſhould grow among them in matter of Faith, who were ſo guided by the Spirit of truth and vnity that they could not in any point either erre themſelues, or lead any other into error? Surely, ſo to thinke, derogateth much from the truth of Chriſt, and imputeth much weakneſſe vnto the Spirit of God, and detracteth from the certainty of <pb n="302" facs="tcp:10362:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> our Faith which dependeth on their preaching. So that for this cauſe it is vnlikely they made this Creed, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to this end.</p>

For out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they could not gather that Chriſt was borne of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> or that hee ſuffered vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> And as for the new, many of the Apoſtles were dead before all was written, and
<hi>Iames</hi> before any was written: beſides that no part of it was written when the Creed was compiled, if it bee true which the legend ſaith. And theſe are the reaſons for which it ſeemeth vnto me more

For when hereſies began to encreaſe and preuaile, the Church thought it neceſſary to ſet forth ſome ſhort Confeſſions, by which the people as by a touchſtone might diſcerne the gold of <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> truth from the copper of errors and hereſies. Saith S. <hi>Hilarie, Nihil mirum videri debet, fratres chariſsimi, quod tam fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter exponi fides caeptae ſint: neceſsitatem hanc furor haereticus imponit:</hi> you ought not to maruell much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren, that nowadayes Creeds are ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth: the fury of hereticks hath layd this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity vpon vs. Thus againſt <hi>Arius</hi> denying the diuinity of Chriſt was the Nicene Creed framed: againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius</hi> and

Thus of late the reformed Churches to quit themſelues of the vniuſt imputations of hereſie and apoſtaſie wherewith they were charged, haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſundrie times to ſet forth ſeuerall Confeſſions of their Faith, all which, or moſt of which are recorded in the harmonie of Confeſſions.

Among the ancient Creeds I ſay: for the Scripture is peerles, and equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with it neither may it chalenge vnto it ſelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any of the ancient Fathers giue it, as aboue wee haue touched. For although the ſubſtance and matter of the Creed be diuine and perfectly according with the Scripture, yet for forme and order of words it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: whereas the Scripture both for ſubſtance and circumſtance, matter and forme and all is no way hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but wholly and entirely diuine. The greater the blaſphemie of <hi>Rhemiſh Ieſuites</hi> auouching this Creed to be the Rule whereby all the writings of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be tried,<note place="margin">In Ro. 12.6.</note> and approued: whereas contrarily the Scripture out of which the Creed is collected, is the only Rule by which both it and all other Creeds are to bee examined. Howbeit the ſecond place, as it is its due, ſo we willingly yeeld vnto it. Firſt in regard of the antiquity thereof, becauſe of all other it is the eldeſt. Secondly, for the perfection and fulnes thereof, there being no one article of abſolute neceſſity vnto <hi>Saluation,</hi> which is not either in expreſſe tearmes or impliedly and in its principles contayned therein. Thirdly and laſtly, becauſe it hath had the vniuerſall approbation of all Churches, in all times, both ancient and moderne. The ancient Fathers giue vnto it moſt honorable and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent titles. They call it, <hi>the key of Faith, the rule of Faith, the foundation of Faith, the ſumme of Faith, the forme of Faith, the body of Faith, the rule of truth, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of humane ſaluation, the myſterie of religion, the character of the Church,</hi> and the like.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:10362:164" rendition="simple:additions"/> rather then on any other Creed: vnto it all others were conformed, ſo as they ſeeme to be but expoſitions of it. Finally, it was their manner neuer to admit any that was <hi>adultus</hi> either to the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or to the holy
<hi>Eucharist</hi> without making confeſſion of his Faith by rehearſing this Creed. In like manner, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Churches</hi> with all reuerence and duty receiue it: they vſe it in their publick
<hi>Liturgies,</hi> and expound it in their <hi>Catechiſmes.</hi> The more malitious is the ſlander of <hi>Gregorie Martin</hi> and others,<note place="margin">Diſc. of Eng. tranſ. c. 12.</note> who ſhame not to ſay that <hi>we hold not the Chriſtian Faith of the articles of the Creed.</hi> Yea, ſaith another of vs, <hi>they haue no faith nor religion,</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>To this argument thus formed I anſwer, firſt by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Maior Propoſition: which in that you goe not about to proue, you commit that fault in reaſoning which Logicians call <hi>Petitionem Principij,</hi> taking that for granted which is moſt queſtioned. For ſuppoſe that Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Prieſts were ſuperfluous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, yet it is not euery ſuperfluity in a Church that takes away the nature and eſſence thereof: and euen they who miſlike the preſent Church gouernement, doe not
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:10362:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> all of them, as you Separatiſts doe, inferre thereupon a nullity, but onely a corruption or aberration in the Church.

For firſt, euery thing (by Antichriſt ordained) is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vnlawfull and Antichriſtian, no more then euery act of a tyrant is vniuſt and tyrannous. How many good and wholeſome lawes were enacted vnder the raigne of
<hi>Richard</hi> the third, who yet was a moſt bloody and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrant? Neither were they afterward repealed by ſucceeding Kings, but ſtand ſtill in force notwithſtanding <pb n="330" facs="tcp:10362:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> his tyranny: for they proceeded from him <hi>non quà ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus,</hi> not as hee was a tyrant, but as hee was a wiſe and politicke gouernour. In like manner, not euery thing ordained by Antichriſt is foorthwith to bee reiected, but onely that which hee doth <hi>quà Antichristus,</hi> as hee is Antichriſt, and is meerely Antichriſtian. It is a great folly to refuſe good counſell becauſe it is giuen by an euill man. Wiſe men will conſider <hi>non quis ſed quid,</hi> not ſo much who doth a thing, as what is done. For as truth is Gods in whoſe mouth ſoeuer it bee found: ſo is good alſo whoſoeuer bee the Author thereof. Againe, if thoſe things whereof Antichriſt is the firſt founder bee not therefore by and by vnlawfull, much leſſe are thoſe things ſo, which being of a former inſtitution are onely vſed and obſerued by him. Were it otherwiſe, how many ordinances of God himſelfe, and wholeſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the primitiue Church would proue vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being ſtill retained in Popery?</p>
                        <p>This Maior you endeauour to fortify with ſundry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture. But as <hi>Caſsius</hi> of old was wont to ſay,
<hi>Cui bono?</hi> to what end? For if you would proue it in the ſenſe granted you, they are alledged needleſly: if in the ſenſe denied, friuolouſly; and to ſpeake the truth euery way vainely and impertinently, as the very reading of them will manifeſt to any one that will but take the paines to peruſe them. But this is the manner of your men to paint your margents with multitude of quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nothing to the purpoſe: whereas one allegation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concluding is more then a hundred demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being the words of the firſt and infallible verity. What you intend hereby I wot not, whether to amuſe the Reader and ouerwhelme him with your numbers, or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:10362:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> to win you credit and eſtimation with the vulgar, as if you were the onely skilfull Text-men. But ſure I am that ſuch ſleighting of Scripture is no leſſe then the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods Name in vaine: which whoſoeuer doth, the Lord profeſſeth he <hi>will not hold him guiltleſse.</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not made nor appointed for pompe and ſhew, but for conqueſt and victory.</p>
                        <p>To the Minor Propoſition I anſwer negatiuely, <hi>The miniſtrie of Arch-biſhops, Lord-Biſhops, and Prieſts</hi> is not Antichriſtian, whether you vnderſtand it as firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antichriſt, or againſt Chriſt. That it is not of Antichriſts inuention is as cleere as the Sunne. For firſt Prieſts are of diuine inſtitution, being no other then thoſe Presbyters or Paſtors, to whom the adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments is committed, and who are ordained by Chriſt for the building vp of his Church vnto the end of the world. The Prieſts of the Church of Rome indeed are of Antichriſts founding, whoſe office is to ſacrifice and offer vp Chriſt himſelfe in the Maſſe vnto his Father both for the quicke and the dead. But our Prieſts haue nothing common with them ſaue the name onely: their idolatry wee deteſt and abhorre, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee retaine the name. Theirs are Maſſe-Prieſts, ours are Preaching or Miniſtring Prieſts. Neither let the name offend you: for notwithſtanding Papiſts haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed it to ſignifie a Sacrificer, yet properly it doth not ſo, being originally deriued from Presbyter, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs is it now ſo vnderſtood. To ſay nothing that the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers (who I preſume were not Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) vſually call the Miniſters of the Goſpell <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> Prieſts. As therefore you cannot without great abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſon from the name to the thing, thus,
<hi>your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <pb n="332" facs="tcp:10362:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> are called Prieſts, Ergo, your Miniſtrie is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:</hi> ſo neither can you without greater abſurdity ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your ſelfe from the thing becauſe of the name, and becauſe our Miniſters are called Prieſts withdraw your ſelfe from our Miniſtrie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Arch-biſhops and Biſhops if they be not of diuine inſtitution, yet were they ſome Centuries of yeeres before euer Antichriſt appeared in the world, as all antiquity and Eccleſiaſticall Story teſtifieth. That moſt famous firſt generall Councell of Nice aſſembled by <hi>Conſtantin the Great</hi> about the yeere of our Lord
327 not onely approueth them, but alſo affirmeth that the Church anciently and long before that time had been gouerned by them. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> &amp;
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> both reckon <hi>Aerius</hi> among the number of Hereticks, for denying the then-receiued and allowed diſtinction between a Biſhop and a Presbyter. But to ſpeake my mind plainely, I am for my part perſwaded, that the ſuperiority of Biſhops ouer the Miniſters was of Apoſtolicall inſtitution. Thoſe Angels to whom Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the ſecond and third of the Reuelation is commanded to write, what other were they then the Biſhops of thoſe Churches of <hi>Aſia?</hi> In <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> one of thoſe ſeuen Churches, it is reported by S. <hi>Luke</hi> that there were many Presbyters, and I doubt not but it was ſo in other of the Churches alſo: howbeit the Apoſtle writeth vnto one onely whom hee calleth the Angell, as being ſingular and eminent aboue the reſt. And the ancient ſtory of the Church recordeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Biſhops of euery one of thoſe Churches together with their ſucceſſors for a long time. So that Biſhops being in the Apoſtles time, and ſucceſſiuely continued in the Primitiue Church, without any contradiction either <pb n="333" facs="tcp:10362:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Apoſtles themſelues or any other, yea rather with their approbation and allowance, as appeareth by thoſe ſeuen Epiſtles vnto the ſeuen Angels, and all the writings of the ancient Fathers: how can it bee imagined but that Biſhops and their ſuperiority ouer others was of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall inſtitution?</p>
                        <p>Now if <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> (for as wee haue ſayd, in ſubſtance they be all one) were ordained by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and <hi>Biſhops</hi> deriue their pedigree alſo from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Apostles</hi> of God: it followeth by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that as our <hi>Miniſtery</hi> is not from <hi>Antichrist,</hi> ſo neither is it againſt Chriſt. Were it againſt Chriſt, it would be either becauſe he hath forbidden it, or for that it deſtroyeth rather then edifieth the
<hi>Church.</hi> But it is no where forbidden. If it bee, ſhew the place, and wee yeeld. Neither doth it hinder the edification of the <hi>Church.</hi> For firſt it is the office both of <hi>Biſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Prieſts</hi> to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt, and to adminiſter his holy
<hi>Sacraments.</hi> Secondly, the aduancement of one <hi>Preſbyter</hi> aboue the reſt, was for the preuention of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> For when
<hi>Factions began to ariſe in the Church, ſome ſaying I am of Paul, others I am of Apollos, I am of Cephas: then, ſayth Hierom, was it decreed through the whole world, that one being choſen from among the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ſhould be ſet ouer the reſt.</hi> Who being ſo prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his duty is to ouerſee the reſt of his brethren, that they carefully diſcharge the office impoſed vpon them, and frame their liues according to the worthines of their calling: All which I am ſure furthereth the building of the
<hi>Church,</hi> ſo farre is it from deſtroying: ſo that nor Prieſts nor <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whether yee regard their offices, or the end of their ordination, can be ſayd to be againſt Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="334" facs="tcp:10362:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>Peraduenture (for I would willingly let nothing paſſe vnanſwered) there lies a miſtery in the word <hi>Lord-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and you intend that they are the more
<hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> for that they are ſo called. Surely if they ſhould ambitiouſly affect the title of <hi>Lord,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did the title of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> it were great pride and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them: and if they ſhould <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Notwithſtanding you endeauour to proue it thus,
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Churches of Antichriſt cannot be compleate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Prelacy, as appeareth,</hi> you ſay, <hi>by the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and Pontificall, and by their Church-conſtitutions.</hi> A ſeely and ſory argument. For firſt, the Miniſtrie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo farre from being a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches of Antichriſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth Anathematize and accurſe it, eſteeming vs (right as you doe) to bee no Church at all becauſe wee want their Miniſtry. Againe, may not I with as good reaſon as you argue thus? The ſtate and Kingdome of Antichriſt cannot be compleate without the authority of Ciuill Magiſtrates: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ciuill Magiſtrates are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian. If this kinde of reaſoning bee not good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is yours; for they are both of one mould. Laſtly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianity being a Myſterie, and not an Heathniſh or Turkiſh oppoſition vnto Chriſt, it cannot be compleate except it retaine many of Chriſts ordinances, which therefore I truſt you will not ſay to bee Antichriſtian. A lie cannot ſubſiſt but vpon truth, nor euill but in good: <pb n="336" facs="tcp:10362:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> nor Antichriſts hypocriſie but vpon the Religion and diſcipline of Chriſt.

But the Miniſtrie of the Church of England cannot bee approued by the Teſtament of Chriſt. Ergo, it is not to bee allowed in the Church.</hi> The Minor which you might be ſure we would deny, you haue left naked to the wide world without proofe: the Maior which you ſaw wee could not well deny, you endeauour to fortifie with a double reaſon. Let it be ſuppoſed then that it is denied how proue you it? Firſt, <hi>The Ministerie had in the Church may and ought to bee ſo approued.</hi> How doth this appeare? By the places quoted in the margent? Nothing leſſe: They approue indeed certaine officers in the Church: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme not that euery officer ought to bee ſo approued. Secondly, if, ſay you, <hi>ſuch as could not deriue their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy from Aaron were depoſed, much more are they to be <pb n="337" facs="tcp:10362:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> depoſed who cannot warrant their offices by Christs Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A poore argument God wot. For in the law there was an expreſſe commandment that none might execute the Prieſts office but hee that was of the linage of <hi>Aaron:</hi> but that no office might bee admitted nor retained in the Church vnleſſe it were ſo commanded, I find no where in Scripture. Wherefore to argue thus, <hi>Nothing that is against Gods Word may bee allowed, Ergo, nor any thing that is not commanded,</hi> is a plaine <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not.

                        <p>Briefly therefore to cleare all, I diſtinguiſh of theſe tearmes, Approued and Warranted by the Word. A thing may bee ſaid to bee warranted or approued by the Word two wayes, both when it is commanded, and when it is not forbidden: for things neither commanded nor forbidden, are indifferent, and ſubiect vnto the Churches power. Hereupon thus I anſwer, if you meane it in the former ſence only, then proue your Maior that what is not by commandment approued is vnlawfull: if in the latter then I grant you the Maior, that whatſoeuer is forbidden is vnlawfull. But withall I deny the Minor, that Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts are forbidden, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to proue it, which I know you can neuer doe. For as touching ſo much of their dutie as is common to them all, to wit, the preaching of the Word, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, they are all Paſtors and Teachers, and ſo warranted in the Texts by you quoted: but in regard of preeminence and ſuperiority one aboue another Biſhops are no other then were the Angels of the ſeuen Churches, as wee haue aboue demonſtrated.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:10362:179" rendition="simple:additions"/> Howſoeuer, if Biſhops bee not commanded, yet are they not forbidden: and their office making not againſt edification, but for it rather, it cannot being ordained by the Church but be lawfull. Your third argument.</p>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10362:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> a double calling, the one is <hi>Gratiae oblatae,</hi> where by God onely inuites men vnto Chriſt, and offers them Grace, the other <hi>Gratiae inditae &amp; infuſae,</hi> whereby hee not only offers but infuſeth grace alſo into them. The former Calling maketh not a man of the Church: for hee that is no otherwiſe called, anſwereth not by Faith, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto Chriſt, but remaineth ſtill in infidelity, and ſo is vtterly excluded out of the Church. Of the latter Calling I diſtinguiſh againe, for it is either that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee beſtoweth vpon man Faith of Doctrine, or that whereby ouer and aboue hee giues them Iuſtification together with true Sanctification. Faith of Doctrine is either a Partiall or an Entire Faith: a Partiall Faith whereby part onely of the Chriſtian verity is held, or an Entire Faith by which the whole ſauing truth is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and profeſſed: And this againe either in Vnity or in Schiſme, in Vnity with other Churches of God, or in Schiſme with Separation from them. Now all theſe and eueryone of them are of the Chriſtian Church: for they are neither Gentiles, nor Iewes, nor Turks, being by the calling of grace brought to the profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. But yet among them there is exceeding great difference: for they that hold the entire truth of Chriſt are of that Chriſtian Church, which is called Oxthodoxall: they that hold it in part onely, are of that Chriſtian Church which is Hereticall. They that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely hold the truth in Vnity with other Churches of God, are of that Chriſtian Orthodoxall Church which is Catholicke: they that hold the ſame whole truth in Separation from them are of that Chriſtian Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall Church which is Schiſmaticall. And ſuch is the Church of Browniſts to which you haue adioyned your <pb n="349" facs="tcp:10362:184" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſelfe. But they who hold the whole truth of Chriſt not onely in Vnity but alſo in Sincerity, being truly iuſtified by Faith and Sanctified in the lauour of Regeneration, they I ſay are of that Chriſtian Orthodoxall Catholicke Church which is Inuiſible and knowne only vnto God. For although both the perſons and profeſſion of thoſe that are thus called, be viſible, and may by outward ſenſe bee diſcerned, whereby in the eye of Charity they are to bee counted Gods elect people: yet the inward truth and ſincerity of the heart is to vs inuiſible, and ſeene of none but onely him who trieth the heart and raines, and ſo alone knoweth who are his.</p>
                     <p>Theſe diſtinctions thus promiſed I come at length to anſwer your Syllogiſme, and demand of you which of theſe Callings it is that you meane. If the laſt, whereby wee haue receiued entirely to belieue the whole truth of Chriſt, and that not onely in Vnity, but alſo in Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and with a ſanctified heart: then I deny the Maior, for it is not the Viſible but the Inuiſible Church alone that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts of ſuch members. Neither can ſuch a Viſible Church bee found vpon the face of the earth: for here corne and cockle, chaffe and wheat, Saints and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrits are mingled together, neither can you affirme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Church whereunto now you aſſociate your ſelfe. If you meane any other of the Callings aboue mentioned, or all of them beſides this laſt, then I deny your Minor. For here in England wee are a company of people to whom not onely grace hath beene offered, but who alſo haue receiued grace to belieue the truth of Chriſt, and therefore are not Infidels but of the Church of Chriſt. Againe we haue receiued to belieue the whole truth, and therefore are an Oxthodoxall not an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb n="350" facs="tcp:10362:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church. Laſtly, wee hold the whole truth of God in Unity with other Churches, and amongſt vs there are thouſands alſo who profeſſe the ſame with ſincere and ſanctified hearts, and therefore wee are not a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall as you are, but a true Catholicke Church. This Minor thus denied you goe not about to ſtrengthen with ſo much as one argument, and yet hither ſhould you haue bent all your forces.

                        <p>Here at length haue you diſcouered vnto vs the very ground of your errour, in that you cannot ſee how a true viſible Church can bee diſtinguiſhed from a falſe, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious offenders bee ſuffered to haue any communion therein. Learne then that true and falſe Churches are differenced by hauing or wanting the forme and eſſence of a Church. The Chriſtian Church is diſcerned from Heathniſh, Iewiſh, Turkiſh congregations by the Chriſtian Faith; an Orthodoxe Church from an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall by an entire Faith: a Catholicke from a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall by an entire Faith held in Unity: and the Inuiſible Church from all other by the Sanctity of euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but this is knowne to God onely, the reſt may bee diſcerned by man alſo. You ought therefore to put a difference between a Corrupt Church and a falſe Church. A falſe Church wanteth the eſſence and therefore is no Church: a corrupt Church wanteth onely the purity it ſhould haue, yet hauing the eſſence it is a Church. Which if you had well conſidered you would not haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <pb n="355" facs="tcp:10362:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> our Church (if yet ſo corrupt as you weene) for no Church, vnleſſe you would alſo ſay a ſicke man were no man: much leſſe would you haue rent your ſelfe from it.</p>
                        <p>And thus you ſee your ſecond ground failes you alſo, and that you haue not demonſtrated that ſound mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to ſeparate themſelues from the communion of the whole body becauſe of a few rotten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. Now therfore except you haue ſtronger arguments then here you haue ſent me, or can adde more ſtrength and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to theſe: I muſt intreate you to remember your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that if it could appeare by euident remonſtrance that your grounds were ſandy &amp; deceitfull, you would retire your ſelfe into the boſome of that Church out of which you haue ſo ſcandalouſly withdrawne your ſelfe.

                  <head>OF VOWES AND SPECIALLY THAT OF VIRGINITY.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OVR deſire to bee reſolued touching the vow of Virginity or Single life, both how law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is, &amp; how farre it bindes. I will endeauour to ſatisfie you as breefly and plainly as I can: firſt ſhewing you what is the nature and definition of a vow in generall, and then applying it vnto your particular queſtion for the more eaſie and fuller determination thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A vow rightly defined is <hi>a promiſe made vnto God of things lawfull, by ſuch as haue power ſo to doe, thereby to teſtify their affection and duty towards him.</hi> This ſhort definition containing the whole and entire nature of a lawfull Vow, I will for your better vnderſtanding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in the ſeuerall parts thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I call it a Promiſe not a Purpoſe: for a Purpoſe being only an inclination of the minde to do ſomething, <pb n="357" facs="tcp:10362:188"/> binds not vnto performance, and is alterable without ſin: But a Promiſe comprehendeth both a Purpoſe and Obligation alſo, binding the Conſcience vnto perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: abſolutely, if the forme of the Promiſe be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, conditionally if conditionall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this promiſe whether it be internally concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the heart or externally vttered by the mouth, it is all one vnto God, who vnderſtandeth as well the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the one as of the other. Yet as in Praying ſo in Vowing ſpeech is not vnprofitable, the ſolemnity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both more inwardly affecting our ſelues, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more edifying others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Party to whom Vowes are to bee directed is God only: for it is a part of diuine worſhip, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the third commandement. A part of diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I ſay ſimply if it bee of things commanded, if of things indifferent accidentally only, inaſmuch as it is referred to the worſhip of God, and therefore cannot without ſacriledge be giuen to any creature.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">Theol. Pract. comp. tract. 2. c. 8. art. 33.</note> How then can the Popiſh Church vowing vnto Saints quit herſelfe of notorious Idolatrie? ſpecially ſeing by the confeſſion of Molanus a principall champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hers, a Vow is an act of latria, that is of ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as is due vnto God. Neither can ſhe cloake her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, with any ſhew of Scripture:<note place="margin">De cult. Sanct. c. 9.</note> for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelfe freely acknowledgeth, that <hi>when the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written, the cuſtome of vowing vnto Saints was not yet begun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The matter of a vow is things lawfull, whether they be neceſſary as being commanded, or arbitrary as being neither forbidden nor commanded. For that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commanded may be vowed appeareth euen by the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:10362:189"/> vow in Baptiſme.<note place="margin">In Pſal.
46.</note> And although vertues, as Chryſoſtom ſaith, <hi>be due vnto God albeit they be not promiſed:</hi> yet what letteth but what God bindeth vs vnto by precept, we by vow as by a new knot may alſo bind our ſelues vnto.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <note place="margin">De Monach. c. 19.</note>7.
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed is bold and affirmeth that it is <hi>the common opinion of Diuines, that the Promiſe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not properly a vow:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inſtit. Mor. l. 11. c. 14.</note> but
<hi>Azorius</hi> his fellow. <hi>Ieſuite</hi> can tell him otherwiſe,
<hi>that the ancient Diuines together with the Maſter of the Sentences ſeeme to thinke that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a vow properly and truly ſo called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. That things of an indifferent and middle nature may alſo be Vowed is granted of all hands, God hauing permitted vnto the Church and members thereof iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpenſation of them. Yet this muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with caution: for ſeeing as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>thoſe things that are lawfull are not alwayes expedient,</hi> and things otherwiſe lawfull may in regard of circumſtance become vnlawfull, thoſe indifferent things that are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with ſuch circumſtances ceaſe during the while to be the matter of a Vow.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Iuſtly therefore are excluded from being the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Uow, firſt all ſuch actions as are in their owne nature euill, next ſuch as hinder a greater good, then thoſe that croſſe the generall Vow made in Baptiſme, farther ſuch as are impoſſible and out of our power, moreouer ſuch as are friuolous and vnprofitable, finally thoſe things that are naturally neceſſary, and if there be any other beſides of the like quality.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I adde farther by ſuch as haue power ſo to doe: for none may Vow but they who by their vocation haue liberty thereunto. Now this vocation in regard of things commanded extendeth vniuerſally vnto all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="359" facs="tcp:10362:189"/> it is free for euery man to vow them. But in reſpect of things indifferent it ſtretcheth not ſo farre: For firſt they who by reaſon of age or diſtemper haue not the vſe of reaſon or iudgment, ſecondly they who are vnder the authority, and iuriſdiction of others, hauing not power of themſelues becauſe of their calling may not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully vow without the conſent and good liking of their ſuperiors.<note place="margin">Num. 30.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. This condemnes the impious practice of Popiſh Friers, who inueigle yong youths from the obedience of their parents, and without their conſents intangle them in the vow of Monaſticall life, treading directly in the ſteps of their Great-grand-father
<hi>Euſtathius,</hi> againſt whoſe wicked doctrine the Councell of
<hi>Gangra</hi> thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,<note place="margin">Can. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>If any children ſhall forſake their Parents eſpecially being faithfull vpon occaſion of Religion thinking it iuſt ſo to doe, and ſhall not rather performe due honor vnto them, reuerencing euen this in them that they are faithfull let them be accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Finally the End of a Vow is partly to teſtify our affection to God, as namely our thankfulneſſe for benefits receiued: and partly our duty in carefulneſſe to preuent ſinne, and to preſerue and increaſe Gods graces in vs. In a word it ſerues as an inſtrument or helping meanes to further our obedience to Gods Lawes. And becauſe the End it ſelfe is of greater importance then the meanes conducing vnto the End, ſurely Obedience muſt needs bee better then Sacrifice, that is, then the Vow which fitteth only vnto it.</p>

The <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> therefore teaching that vowes are of greater perfection in this life, and deſerue an higher degree of glory in the next, then the very works <pb n="360" facs="tcp:10362:190"/> of the Morall law, cannot be excuſed of manifeſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.<note place="margin">Comment. in Mat. 19.</note> Which it ſeemes <hi>Cardinal Cajetan</hi> alſo ſaw when he ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt preſcribeth no vow to him that will obtaine perfection of life: becauſe the obtaining of perfection conſisteth not in the bonds of vowes but in the works themſelues.</hi>

This being the true nature and definition of a vow, I conclude as touching the Obligation or bond thereof, that euery vow thus made vnto God, in ſuch Forme, of ſuch Matter, by ſuch Perſons, to ſuch End, as wee haue ſaid, bindeth the Conſcience vnto perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: in ſo much as the breach thereof is no leſſe then mortall ſin, and very diſhonorable vnto God.

                     <note place="margin">Deut. 23.21.</note>15. But what if a man haue raſhly vowed that which is vnlawfull? Surely in ſuch a caſe it is better to retract the vow, then by keeping it to adde ſin vnto ſin. For a vow, ſaith the Canon, may not be the bond of iniquity: and excellently to this purpoſe counſelleth <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi>

                     <hi>Let ſuch a one therefore abſtaine,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>humbly entreat God of his Clemency to pardon the vnaduiſed raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wherby he was ſo headlongly carried to ſweare: for to double the offence when thou mayſt diſcharge thy ſelfe of the one halfe, is extreame madnes, and ſcarcely euer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>

                  <p n="16">16. Now let vs apply what hath beene ſaid vnto the particular vow of virginity, or ſingle life. And firſt whereas nothing may be the Matter of a vow but that which is lawfull, and things lawfull are of two ſorts, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply and morally good, or arbitrary and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:10362:190"/> ſurely Virginity cannot be ranked in the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

And therefore howſoeuer it may giue a kind of luſter and grace vnto vertue, yet vertue it can be none.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Hereupon it followeth that Virginity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage are not in themſelues acceptable vnto God one more then another, but that it is the mind which rightly vſeth both the one and the other which is pleaſing vnto him: and that they are rather diuers ſorts of life, then differences or degrees of liuing better or worſe.

                  <p n="23">23. But ſaith Doctor Biſhop, Continency is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation vnto all thoſe that haue Vowed it: for the breach of the Vow is diſhonour vnto God, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto themſelues, and therefore being neceſſary, wee ſhall vſing the meanes aſſuredly obtaine it. This is right to ſubiect the prouidence of God in the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe peculiar gifts vnto our temerity and raſhnes. I beſeech you, if a man haue vowed to propheſie, or to ſpeake with ſtrange tongues, or to worke miracles, muſt God needs beſtow thoſe gifts vpon him vpon his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſuite, leaſt otherwiſe hee ſhould breake his vow, and hazard his ſaluation?</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nſteed of a few words which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to write you, I haue here ſent this little treatiſe, which if you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read and peruſe, it will more fully informe and reſolue you then I ſhould haue done. Neuertheleſſe, that I may in ſome ſort diſcharge my promiſe, and not altogether faile your expectation, in few words thus. I would wiſh you diligently to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that to bee grieued and troubled for ſinne is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty, and that it ought to be ſo. For as in the poole of
<hi>Betheſda</hi> there could bee no cure wrought vntill the Angell had troubled the water: ſo neither is there any remiſſion of ſinnes and healing of the ſoule, vntill by the worke of Gods Spirit the heart bee bruzed and broken. When ſuch an Angell as <hi>Peter</hi> was, ſhall by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching haue pricked the Conſcience, and made men both to ſee their ſinne, and to feele the miſery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: then and not before doe they crie out, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall wee doe?</hi> Sorrow for ſinne is a bleſſed ſorrow. A broken and contrite ſpirit God neuer yet deſpiſed. Thoſe, and thoſe alone who feele the heauy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:10362:193"/> loade and burden of their ſinnes doth Chriſt inuite vnto him, and vnto them doth hee promiſe refreſhment. Hee that oftentimes watered his couch with his teares, and as oftentaſted the ſweet conſolations of Gods bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hath out of his experience ſeriouſly affirmed that whoſoeuer ſoweth in teares ſhall ſurely reap in ioy, and a day of reioycing ſhall euer ſucceed the night of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And to ſpeake the truth, ſorrow was made for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for ſinne. A potion is made onely for that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which it is able to cure: and ſorrow for that onely which it is able to remedie. Loſſe of friends, health, wealth and the like were neuer yet recouered with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but the teares of true repentance haue euer cleanſed the ſoule from ſinne, and purchaſed both pardon and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from God. Sorrow therefore was made onely for ſinne. Mourne then in Gods name for your ſinnes: but yet take heed you mourne not as thoſe that are without hope. You cannot doe a greater wrong vnto the infinite mercy of God, and the inualuable merits of Chriſt your Sauiour, then to thinke them leſſe then your ſinnes or demerits. If Satan ſuggeſt any ſuch thing vnto you, ſpare him not, but tell him hee lies: for Gods goodnes cannot bee outreached by mans wickedneſſe, and where ſinne doth abound, grace doth much more abound. If your ſinnes were as red as ſcarlet, yet vpon your true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance God both can and will make you as white as ſnow: And of your repentance you cannot well make doubt, there being in you, as you haue confeſſed vnto mee, both hearty ſorrow for ſinnes paſt, and vnfained reſolution of amendement for the time to come, which are the two eſſentiall parts of true repentance. Yea but you haue committed that ſinne which is vnto death and <pb n="368" facs="tcp:10362:194" rendition="simple:additions"/> can neuer bee forgiuen nor in this nor in the next world. If ſo, to what end doe you ſeeke vnto mee for comfort? And why doe I waſt paper in writing vnto you? But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground haue you entertayned this conceit? Forſooth you haue often ſworne and forſworne againſt your knowledge. I will not extenuate your ſin: it is I confeſſe grieuous and fearefull, neither would I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder you from a long pennance in ſackcloth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes for the ſame. Howbeit I would aduiſe you to ſteere right betweene theſe two dangerous gulfes: for as you muſt not make mole-hils of mountaines, nor frailties of furies, ſo neither muſt you of euery ſinne, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heinous and enormious make that vnpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. It is not often ſwearing or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, no nor forſwearing or periury and the like, which God neither can nor will forgiue. For then what ſhould become of that worthy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwore his Lord and Sauiour, euen againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that not once but thrice, with moſt horrible execration and curſing? you haue not ſinned in ſo high a nature as <hi>Peter</hi> did, neuertheleſſe now that Chriſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backe vpon you as hee did on him, touching your heart with conſideration of what you haue done, I giue you good leaue to goe foorth with him and to weep as bitterly as you can. But deſpaire not of pardon, nor count it the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, for ſo did not hee. That ſinne is no leſſe then a wilfull, malicious, and obſtinate denying of the foundation, namely that Ieſus is the Mediator and Redeemer of the world. It is a totall apoſtaſie from the Faith, when the whole man reuolteth from the whole Chriſtian Religion wholly, with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſolution neuer to returne to it any more. This <pb n="369" facs="tcp:10362:194"/> ſinne I know you are farre from, and you dare not ſay you haue committed it. Neither is it poſſible for him that is guilty thereof to doe as you now a long time haue done, that is to mourne and lament for his ſinnes. His ſtubborne and reprobate heart is not ſo tender, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt all ſorrow and feeling rather reioyceth in his deſperate and malicious obſtinacy. More I might write, but let this little booke I ſend you bee inſteed thereof. It remayneth that henceforward you play the valiant ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chriſt, and ſuffer not your ſelfe any longer to be led by paſſion, but onely by the rules and directions of Gods bleſſed Word. For my part I will not ceaſe to pray vnto the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for you, that this pricke may be eftſoones taken from you: or if for you further exerciſe and triall hee delay you a little longer, that yet your Faith may ſettle and reſt vpon that anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which God gaue vnto <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the like caſe,

9.6.</note> it will not I truſt be denied, but that <hi>Mary</hi> is the Mother of him that was Crucified, that died, that <hi>ſhed his bloud,</hi> that was ſeene with the eye, and felt with the hand.<note place="margin">1.

<hi>Mary</hi> alſo the Mother of the Lord of glory, the Mother of the Lord of life, the Mother of him that is equall with God, and conſequently God, ſeeing none is equall vnto God but God.</p>
                  <p>As Scripture, ſo the Analogie of Faith alſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it. For no reaſon can be rendred why <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould not be the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> but eyther becauſe Chriſt is not God, or becauſe the humanity was the ſubject of Conception and Birth before it was aſſumpted by the Word, or laſtly becauſe the Humanity was neuer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpted into the Vnity of the ſame Perſon, but remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a diſtinct perſon by it ſelfe: all which were the damnable blaſphemies and hereſies of <hi>Arius, Photinus, and Neſtorius,</hi> the firſt of <hi>Arius,</hi> the ſecond of
<hi>Photinus,</hi> the third of <hi>Nestorius.</hi> Therefore contrarywiſe I argue thus, If Chriſt bee God, and the Humanity were at the firſt creation thereof preuented from ſubſiſting in it ſelfe, and neuer had ſubſiſtence but in the Word, ſo as both Natures conſtitute one onely
<hi>Hypoſtaſis or Perſon:</hi> certenly there cannot bee two Sonnes, one of God, and another of Mary, but the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> muſt needs be the Sonne of Mary, and ſo Mary be the <hi>Mother of the Sonne of God.</hi> And as by reaſon of this <hi>Hypoſtaticall vnion Chriſt</hi> himſelfe doubted not to ſay, <hi>The Sonne of Man came <pb n="376" facs="tcp:10362:198"/> downe from heauen:</hi> ſo the ſame analogie and proportion of Faith requires vs to ſay, <hi>The Sonne of God is borne of the Virgin Mary,</hi> which as
<hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> ſaith, is moſt catholickly beleeued, and moſt impiouſly denied.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be added hereunto: but to them that iudge of perſons by the Faith this is too much, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough euen to them that iudge of Faith by Perſons. Only from hence I inferre firſt that <hi>Titius</hi> confounding Papiſts in open pulpit for calling the bleſſed Virgin
<hi>Deiparam, the Mother of God,</hi> either knew not what he ſaid, and ſo proued himſelfe but a nouice in Diuinity: or if he ſpake aduiſedly and out of iudgement, it was no leſſe then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed hereſy. Secondly that I diſapprouing <hi>Titius</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cannot iuſtly bee taxed of tricks or niceties or <hi>ſpirit of contradiction,</hi> vnleſſe together with mee, <hi>Councels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Proteſtants, the Apostolicall and Chalcedonian Creed, Scripture and the Analogie of Faith,</hi> vndergoe the ſame cenſure.
